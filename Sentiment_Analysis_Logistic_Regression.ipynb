      "['Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy. It ran at the same time as some other programs about school life, such as \"Teachers\". My 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that Bromwell High\\'s satire is much closer to reality than is \"Teachers\". The scramble to survive financially, the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers\\' pomp, the pettiness of the whole situation, all remind me of the schools I knew and their students. When I saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school, I immediately recalled ......... at .......... High. A classic line: INSPECTOR: I\\'m here to sack one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I expect that many adults of my age think that Bromwell High is far fetched. What a pity that it isn\\'t!', 'Homelessness (or Houselessness as George Carlin stated) has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school, work, or vote for the matter. Most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism, the war on Iraq, pressuring kids to succeed, technology, the elections, inflation, or worrying if they\\'ll be next to end up on the streets.<br /><br />But what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home, the entertainment sets, a bathroom, pictures on the wall, a computer, and everything you once treasure to see what it\\'s like to be homeless? That is Goddard Bolt\\'s lesson.<br /><br />Mel Brooks (who directs) who stars as Bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival (Jeffery Tambor) to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries; if Bolt succeeds, he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings. The bet\\'s on where Bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he can\\'t step off the sidewalk. He\\'s given the nickname Pepto by a vagrant after it\\'s written on his forehead where Bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of Molly (Lesley Ann Warren) an ex-dancer who got divorce before losing her home, and her pals Sailor (Howard Morris) and Fumes (Teddy Wilson) who are already used to the streets. They\\'re survivors. Bolt isn\\'t. He\\'s not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it\\'s fight or flight, kill or be killed.<br /><br />While the love connection between Molly and Bolt wasn\\'t necessary to plot, I found \"Life Stinks\" to be one of Mel Brooks\\' observant films where prior to being a comedy, it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, or Spaceballs for the matter, to show what it\\'s like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don\\'t know what to do with their money. Maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like Monopoly money.<br /><br />Or maybe this film will inspire you to help others.', 'Brilliant over-acting by Lesley Ann Warren. Best dramatic hobo lady I have ever seen, and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none. The corn on face is a classic, as good as anything in Blazing Saddles. The take on lawyers is also superb. After being accused of being a turncoat, selling out his boss, and being dishonest the lawyer of Pepto Bolt shrugs indifferently \"I\\'m a lawyer\" he says. Three funny words. Jeffrey Tambor, a favorite from the later Larry Sanders show, is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto. His character is more malevolent than usual. The hospital scene, and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site, are all-time classics. Look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting (one bleeds). This movie gets better each time I see it (which is quite often).', 'This is easily the most underrated film inn the Brooks cannon. Sure, its flawed. It does not give a realistic view of homelessness (unlike, say, how Citizen Kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers, or Titanic gave a realistic view of Italians YOU IDIOTS). Many of the jokes fall flat. But still, this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not, and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive. Its not The Fisher King, but its not crap, either. My only complaint is that Brooks should have cast someone else in the lead (I love Mel as a Director and Writer, not so much as a lead).', 'This is not the typical Mel Brooks film. It was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable. Leslie Ann Warren made the movie, she is such a fantastic, under-rated actress. There were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more, and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so, but all in all, this is worth the price to rent and see it. The acting was good overall, Brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience. Again, Warren was the best actor in the movie, but \"Fume\" and \"Sailor\" both played their parts well.', \"This isn't the comedic Robin Williams, nor is it the quirky/insane Robin Williams of recent thriller fame. This is a hybrid of the classic drama without over-dramatization, mixed with Robin's new love of the thriller. But this isn't a thriller, per se. This is more a mystery/suspense vehicle through which Williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeper.<br /><br />Also starring Sandra Oh and Rory Culkin, this Suspense Drama plays pretty much like a news report, until William's character gets close to achieving his goal.<br /><br />I must say that I was highly entertained, though this movie fails to teach, guide, inspect, or amuse. It felt more like I was watching a guy (Williams), as he was actually performing the actions, from a third person perspective. In other words, it felt real, and I was able to subscribe to the premise of the story.<br /><br />All in all, it's worth a watch, though it's definitely not Friday/Saturday night fare.<br /><br />It rates a 7.7/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.\", \"Yes its an art... to successfully make a slow paced thriller.<br /><br />The story unfolds in nice volumes while you don't even notice it happening.<br /><br />Fine performance by Robin Williams. The sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film. However, the core plot is very engaging. The movie doesn't rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering. The direction is good. Use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good.<br /><br />Very nice 1 time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story!\", 'In this \"critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events, Gabriel (Robin Williams), a celebrated writer and late-night talk show host, becomes captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother (Toni Collette). When troubling questions arise about this boy\\'s (story), however, Gabriel finds himself drawn into a widening mystery that hides a deadly secret\\x85\" according to film\\'s official synopsis.<br /><br />You really should STOP reading these comments, and watch the film NOW...<br /><br />The \"How did he lose his leg?\" ending, with Ms. Collette planning her new life, should be chopped off, and sent to \"deleted scenes\" land. It\\'s overkill. The true nature of her physical and mental ailments should be obvious, by the time Mr. Williams returns to New York. Possibly, her blindness could be in question - but a revelation could have be made certain in either the \"highway\" or \"video tape\" scenes. The film would benefit from a re-editing - how about a \"director\\'s cut\"? <br /><br />Williams and Bobby Cannavale (as Jess) don\\'t seem, initially, believable as a couple. A scene or two establishing their relationship might have helped set the stage. Otherwise, the cast is exemplary. Williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization, and not a \"gay impersonation\". Sandra Oh (as Anna), Joe Morton (as Ashe), and Rory Culkin (Pete Logand) are all perfect.<br /><br />Best of all, Collette\\'s \"Donna\" belongs in the creepy hall of fame. Ms. Oh is correct in saying Collette might be, \"you know, like that guy from \\'Psycho\\'.\" There have been several years when organizations giving acting awards seemed to reach for women, due to a slighter dispersion of roles; certainly, they could have noticed Collette with some award consideration. She is that good. And, director Patrick Stettner definitely evokes Hitchcock - he even makes getting a sandwich from a vending machine suspenseful.<br /><br />Finally, writers Stettner, Armistead Maupin, and Terry Anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywhere.<br /><br />******* The Night Listener (1/21/06) Patrick Stettner ~ Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Sandra Oh, Rory Culkin', \"THE NIGHT LISTENER (2006) **1/2 Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Bobby Cannavale, Rory Culkin, Joe Morton, Sandra Oh, John Cullum, Lisa Emery, Becky Ann Baker. (Dir: Patrick Stettner) <br /><br />Hitchcockian suspenser gives Williams a stand-out low-key performance.<br /><br />What is it about celebrities and fans? What is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm? <br /><br />In the latest derange fan scenario, based on true events no less, Williams stars as a talk-radio personality named Gabriel No one, who reads stories he's penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named Pete Logand (Culkin) who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to No one's editor Ashe (Morton) who gives it to No one to read for himself. <br /><br />No one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of Pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named Donna (Collette giving an excellent performance) who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with No one reveals that Pete is dying from AIDS. Naturally No one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover Jess (Cannavale) whose sudden departure from their New York City apartment has No one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into Donna and Pete's backgrounds discovering some truths that he didn't anticipate.<br /><br />Written by Armistead Maupin (who co-wrote the screenplay with his former lover Terry Anderson and the film's novice director Stettner) and based on a true story about a fan's hoax found out has some Hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned pot-boiler does. It helps that Williams gives a stand-out, low-key performance as the conflicted good-hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him (the one thing that has escaped his own reality) and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy Collette whose one physical trait I will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the core.<br /><br />However the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by Stettner, it pays to listen to your own inner voice: be careful of what you hope for.\", 'You know, Robin Williams, God bless him, is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade (with perhaps the exception of \"Death To Smoochy\", which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic). The dramas he has made lately have been fantastic, especially \"Insomnia\" and \"One Hour Photo\". \"The Night Listener\", despite mediocre reviews and a quick DVD release, is among his best work, period.<br /><br />This is a very chilling story, even though it doesn\\'t include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter. The concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed. In high school, I read an autobiography by a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted AIDS as a result. I was moved by the story until I read reports online that Johnson may not actually exist. When I saw this movie, the confused feelings that Robin Williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind.<br /><br />Toni Collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic \"caretaker\". Her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like \"Little Miss Sunshine\". There were even times she looked into the camera where I thought she was staring right at me. It takes a good actress to play that sort of role, and it\\'s this understated (yet well reviewed) role that makes Toni Collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an Academy Award (as of 2008). It\\'s incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this, and it\\'s scary too.<br /><br />This is a good, dark film that I highly recommend. Be prepared to be unsettled, though, because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end.', 'When I first read Armistead Maupins story I was taken in by the human drama displayed by Gabriel No one and those he cares about and loves. That being said, we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of Hollywood...<br /><br />Writer Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner have truly succeeded! <br /><br />With just the right amount of restraint Robin Williams captures the fragile essence of Gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel life(Jess) and the world around him(Donna).<br /><br />As we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably. The request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps Gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward.<br /><br />It\\'s to bad that most people will avoid this film. I only say that because the average American will probably think \"Robin Williams in a serious role? That didn\\'t work before!\" PLEASE GIVE THIS MOVIE A CHANCE! Robin Williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people. Like his movie One Hour Photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art.<br /><br />Oh and before I forget, I believe Bobby Cannavale as Jess steals every scene he is in. He has the 1940\\'s leading man looks and screen presence. It\\'s this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now!!<br /><br />S~', \"I liked the film. Some of the action scenes were very interesting, tense and well done. I especially liked the opening scene which had a semi truck in it. A very tense action scene that seemed well done.<br /><br />Some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time lapse photography, unusual colors, or interesting angles. Also the film is funny is several parts. I also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too. I'd give the film an 8 out of 10.\", 'There are many illnesses born in the mind of man which have been given life in modern times. Constant vigilance or accrued information in the realm of Pyschosis, have kept psychologists, counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last them decades. Occasionally, some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their remedy or even of their existence. That is the premise of the film entitled \" The Night Listner.\" It tells the story of a popular radio host called Gabriel Noon (Robin Williams) who spends his evenings enthralling his audiences with vivid stories about Gay lifestyles. Perhaps its because his show is losing it\\'s authentic veneer which causes Noon to admit he is no longer himself. Feeling abandoned by both his lover Jess (Bobby Cannavale) and his and best friend (Joe Morton), he seeks shelter in his deepening despair and isolation. It is here, a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help. Noon needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a 14 year old boy called Peter (Rory Culkin). In reading the boy\\'s harrowing manuscript which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents, Noon is captivated and wants to help. However, things are not what they seem and Noon soon finds himself en-wrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare. This movie is pure Robin Williams and were it not for Toni Collette who plays Donna D. Logand, Sandra Oh as Anna and John Cullum as pop, this might be comical. Instead, this may prove to be one of William\\'s more serious performances. ***', \"I enjoyed The Night Listener very much. It's one of the better movies of the summer.<br /><br />Robin Williams gives one of his best performances. In fact, the entire cast was very good. All played just the right notes for their characters - not too much and not too little. Sandra Oh adds a wonderful comic touch. Toni Collette is great as the Mom, and never goes over the top. Everyone is very believable.<br /><br />It's a short movie, just under an hour and a half. I noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the Sundance version. I wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie.<br /><br />The director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion, which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well.<br /><br />Do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads. It is not a Hitchcockian thriller. See The Night Listener because you want to see a good story told well. If you go expecting Hitchcock you will be disappointed.<br /><br />My only complaint with the movie was the ending. The director could have left a little more to the audience's imagination, but this is a minor quibble.\", \"The Night Listener is probably not one of William's best roles, but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie. I can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before. Some people maybe won't like the slow pacing of this movie, but I think it's the great plus of the movie. It is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year 2006. It has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content, dramatic feeling. This is no americanized movie. Neither is it a predictable movie. You just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be. This is no excellent movie that has everything, but hell, it's a damn good and very original movie.\", 'Like one of the previous commenters said, this had the foundations of a great movie but something happened on the way to delivery. Such a waste because Collette\\'s performance was eerie and Williams was believable. I just kept waiting for it to get better. I don\\'t think it was bad editing or needed another director, it could have just been the film. It came across as a Canadian movie, something like the first few seasons of X-Files. Not cheap, just hokey. Also, it needed a little more suspense. Something that makes you jump off your seat. The movie reached that moment then faded away; kind of like a false climax. I can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away from the \"reality\" of the story but I thought that part was reached when Gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy. This movie needs to have a Director\\'s cut that tries to fix these problems.', \"The Night Listener held my attention, with Robin Williams shining as a New York City radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a 14 year old boy (Rory Culkin) who is very ill. Williams has never met the boy in person, as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone. However, Williams' ex-boyfriend (nice job from Bobby Cannavale) raises doubt about the boy, which prompts Williams to arrange a meeting with him in person. What follows makes a permanent impact on Williams in a way he does not expect. I will leave it at that. Toni Collette also stars.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film, with Toni Collette giving a memorable portrayal of Culkin's adoptive mother. Sandra Oh also starred as Williams' friend. The Night Listener is inspired by actual events, and it has a somber, almost creepy silence throughout. At times it is predictable, no thanks to some of the reviews I read before seeing the movie and just due to logic, but I liked it anyway. I enjoy Williams in roles like this, more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me. Recommended. 8/10\", \"Popular radio storyteller Gabriel No one(Robin Williams,scraggy and speaking in hushed,hypnotic tones) becomes acquainted and friends with a fourteen-year-old boy from Wisconsin named Pete Logand(Rory Culkin),who has written a book detailing sexual abuse from his parents. To boot,Pete has AIDS and this compels Gabriel further still,since his partner Jess(Bobby Cannavale,good)happens to be a survivor of HIV himself. <br /><br />He also acquaints himself with Pete's guardian,a woman named Donna(Toni Collette,brilliant!)and when Gabriel decides he wants to meet and talk to the two of them in person and goes to Wisconsin,he discovers some secrets he was(naturally)not prepared to find.<br /><br />Based on real events that happened to Armistead Maupin(who co-wrote the screenplay with Terry Anderson)and directed by Patrick Stetner,this film moves a lot faster(90 min.,maybe a few minutes longer)than one might think a movie of this genre would run. That's good in that it keeps the action and storyline lean and clear. It's bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and doesn't sew-up any of the plot openings or back-story. I'd rather not go into any great detail except to say that,if you are not familiar with Mr.Maupin's works or his personal story,you feel a little bit out of the loop here. Still,the performances by Williams( I would've loved to heard more of his narration,personally),Collette,Cannavale,Culkin and much of the supporting cast(the Waitress at the restaurant Collete's Donna frequents does a great job with what small part she has!)are top-notch and the mood established here--namely,the chilly,lonely dark exteriors of Wisconsin and New York--give a terrific framing for this story. It may have ends that don't tie together particularly well,but it's still a compelling enough story to stick with.\", \"If there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing. The premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery, and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about. However, there is not much tension, and Williams' mild mannered portrayal doesn't do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy.<br /><br />Collete fares much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear. The production felt rushed and holes are apparent. It certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort. The book is probably better.<br /><br />One thing is certain: Taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort.\", 'I absolutely LOVED this film! I do not at all relate to all the other comments I have read about it. I was COMPLETELY enthralled through every second! <br /><br />I found the story gripping, the acting intense, and the direction spot-on. I would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie. Even though there was nothing \"scary\" about the story itself, I was soundly on edge through the whole movie - and for the rest of my evening. <br /><br />I found that there were so many perfect choices made...the casting, the script, the little bits of humor sprinkled in it. There were so many points where the film could\\'ve gone for the cheap thrill, but it never did, and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately...and for the last number of years.', 'This Night Listener is better than people are generally saying. It has weaknesses, and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis, no doubt, but I think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this. The whole thing feels like one of those fireside \"this happened to a friend of a friend of mine\" ghost stories. One big complaint about the movie is the pacing: but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate. Everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility, and real life just sort of plods along\\x97no? So there are no flashy endings or earth-shattering revelations, no \"showdown\" scenes. Thank Heaven. You have to get into the zone when watching this movie, forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a (conventionally)good movie. Williams isn\\'t terrific, but he easily meets the needs of the story, plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic (\"No One\") as he is the Everyman, the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story. Toni Collette\\'s performance should be nominated for an Oscar (even if she maybe shouldn\\'t win it). Give it a shot. For quality and content alone, The Night Listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days.', 'When it comes to movies I can be pretty picky, and I\\'ll complain about anything and everything that is done wrong. While every movie has its flaws, The Night Listener had an exceptionally low count.<br /><br />If you read the last review (it was hard, since half of it was written in caps and it contained no actual information about the movie), you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done. Unfortunately, if you read more than 3 lines into that same review, you discovered the poster\\'s reason for disdain: he/she does not like the fact that the director is gay (or that the production team smokes crack...apparently).<br /><br />So, despite the fact that I have never written a review before, I thought this movie deserved one based on its merits, not the sexual orientation of its director. Let\\'s go over a quick checklist first: 1. Great plot? Absolutely. I won\\'t give a shred of it away, but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials. This is a thriller, not a horror, and it should be approached as such. The story really will amaze you, even more so because it\\'s true (and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual events).<br /><br />2. Wonderful Acting? Oh Yes. Robin Williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy type-cast, and he has since flourished in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off just a decade ago. He once again achieves high form in his role in The Night Listener, playing a radio host who becomes increasingly troubled by and entangled in a case of...well, I\\'ll let you see for yourself.<br /><br />3. Excellent direction? Certainly. Now, unlike the other poster to which I referred, I actually know something about direction. I\\'ve been sutdying the art of direction at school now for 3 years. Of course I really don\\'t think that makes a lick of difference (the only thing that matters is if YOU like the direction), but I thought I should simply establish once again that I\\'m basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevant...for example: not the sexual orientation of the director (or the alleged drug habits of the production team, LOL).<br /><br />Patrick Stettner\\'s direction was moody and dark, and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those so-sought-after feelings of \"tension and release\" rather than the messy, fast-paced camera-work and quick cuts we\\'re so often subjected to today. Some people can truly show you a story through their camera, while other\\'s feel as if they have to make the story with the camera. I really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized, which is as an eyeball through which we all see.<br /><br />4. Lighting, cinematography, and editing? Great all around. I\\'ve already wrote so much, and I could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs, so I\\'ll just wrap it up.<br /><br />In short, go see this movie. Don\\'t listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it, especially if they\\'re so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 1/4 of the way through their post. Enjoy the show! -Ben', 'Somewhat funny and well-paced action thriller that has Jamie Foxx as a hapless, fast-talking hoodlum who is chosen by an overly demanding U.S. Treasury Agent (David Morse) to be released on the streets of New York to find a picky computer thief/hacker (Doug Hutchinson), who stole forty-two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot dead.<br /><br />\"Bait\" marks the sophomore feature for Antoine Fuqua (\"The Replacement Killers\") and he handles the task fairly well even though it doesn\\'t top his first movie. What the two films have in common is the action sequences, which are flat-out excellent.<br /><br />Foxx is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning, but throughout the film, I began to catch on. Hutchinson is marvelous as the mastermind who can be ruthless as John Malkovich and patient as the late Laurence Olivier was in \"Marathon Man\". Morse is okay as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get whoever did it at all cost.', 'The legendary Boris Karloff ended his illustrious career by making four cheapie fright flick clunkers in Mexico. This is the token moody period Gothic horror entry from the bunch. Karloff gives a typically spry and dignified performance as Matthias Morteval, an elderly eccentric patriarch who invites several of his petty, greedy and backbiting no-count relatives to his creepy rundown castle for the reading of a will. Pretty soon the hateful guests are getting bumped off by lethal life-sized toy people who populate the place. Onetime Mexican sex symbol Andres Garcia of \"Tintorera\" infamy portrays the dashing police officer hero and Julissa looks absolutely ravishing as the sole likable female character. The clunky, plodding (non)direction, trite by-the-numbers script, ugly, washed-out cinematography, ridiculous murder set pieces (a gross fat slob gets blasted right in the face by a miniature cannon!), overwrought string score, morbid gloom-doom atmosphere, largely lousy acting (Karloff notably excepted), cheesy mild gore, poor dubbing and rousing fiery conclusion all lend this enjoyably awful lemon a certain endearingly cruddy and hence oddly amusing ratty charm. A real campy hoot.', 'This tale based on two Edgar Allen Poe pieces (\"The Fall of the House of Usher\", \"Dance of Death\" (poem) ) is actually quite creepy from beginning to end. It is similar to some of the old black-and-white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house (for example, \"The Cat and the Canary\", \"The Old Dark House\", \"Night of Terror\" and so on). Boris Karloff plays a demented inventor of life-size dolls that terrorize the guests. He dies early in the film (or does he ? ) and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences. I won\\'t go into too much detail here, but it is definitely a must-see for fans of old dark house mysteries.<br /><br />Watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room.<br /><br />Dan Basinger 8/10', 'Aro Tolbukhin burnt alive seven people in a Mission in Guatemala in the 70\\'s. Also he declared that he had murdered another 16 people (he used to kill pregnant women, and then he set them on fire).<br /><br />This movie is a documentary that portraits the personality of Aro through several interviews with people that got to know him and through some scenes played by actors based on real facts.<br /><br />\"Aro Tolbukhin\" is a serious work, so analytical, it\\'s not morbid at all. Such a horrifying testimony about how some childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster.<br /><br />*My rate: 7/10', 'After seeing several movies of Villaronga, I had a pretty clear opinion about him -- he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters, forgetting about a rhythm of the movie. That is why, though having good critics, his movies never caught the broad audience attention. In ARo he follows the same line, but really improved on the rhythm, especially in the end of the movie. Frankly speaking, I slept through the first part, cause though the first part gives necessary information, it is really slow. Nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by Villaronga.<br /><br />Recommended.', \"There's so many things to fall for in Aro Tolbukhin. En la mente del asesino (Inside the killer's mind), that it's very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning. Let's just say that this movie is like an exercise in cinema but really, really great done. It´s made with super 8, black and white shots, 35 milimeters, color, interviews, flashbacks. Aro Tolbukhin it´s like a movie made a documental or viceversa, which most peculiar aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering, did he really ever existed? The movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in Guatemala, worked in a religious mission and then killed some people. An act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced. The movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death. Nowadays, some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character. The one we are witness of -the movie.<br /><br />For the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside Aro´s mind, mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done. Nevertheless, the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view; they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions, we clearly never justify them. So, the first half is based upon recollecting information; later things turn into Aro's childhood, giving the movie such an incredible new force (even tough never got weak or boring).<br /><br />I don't mean -and don't want- to spoil anything; so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you, believe me, the trip to see it is more than worthy.\", 'This has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen. The giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre. This unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story. The casts is outstanding, including TOM BOSLEY who as far as I know never has been in a horror movie before, ever. The effects are impressive and the idea of a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one. My one complaint, I just wish we saw more of the giant mummy, but other then that I think they did a great job. The dialog, the characters and the story was perfect. The acting was wonderful. This has got to be the best movie to come out of the sci-fi channel. You heard me, the best movie to come out of the sci-fi channel. I give THE FALLEN ONES 9 OUT OF 10.', \"Without Kirsten Miller this project needn't have been completed. However with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is Miss Miller I would definitely recommend it. It looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance. Wagner's dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing, but his few scenes didn't detract from being entertained. Mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line, the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster. The charismatic Miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable. She plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be. I wish I had seen this on the big screen but alas I was fortunate to rent it before it was lost.\", \"Sure, Titanic was a good movie, the first time you see it, but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change. The first time you see the movie you see the underlying love-story and think: ooh, how romantic. The second time (and I am not the only one to think this) it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking, When is this d**n ship going to sink??? And even this is not as impressive when you see it several times. The acting in this film is not bad, but definetly not great either. Was I glad DiCaprio did not win an oscar for that film, I mean who does he think he is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He does 1 half-good movie and won't do a film for less than $20 million. And then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it. But enough about, in my eyes, the worst character of the film. Kate Winslet's performance on the other hand was wonderful. I also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together. There is one lesson to be learned about this movie: there are too many love-stories as it is, filmmakers shouldn't try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie!!! Out of a possible 100% I give this film a mere 71%.\", \"When I saw this movie I was stunned by what a great movie it was. This is the only movie I think I would ever give a 10 star rating. I am sure this movie will always be in my top 5.<br /><br />The acting is superb. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett are at their best. I don't think anyone could have a better job than Kate. <br /><br />If it is a rainy day and you can't decide what to rent, well, this is the one. You will love all the acting, special effects, and much much more.<br /><br />If you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now!!! You won't regret it.<br /><br />\", \"Why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like The Godfather. Titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st Century.With great acting,directing,effects,music and generally everything. This movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didn't like it any more so most of the world decided to agree. There is nothing wrong with this movie. All I can say is that this movie, not only being the most heavily Oscar Awarded movie of all time, the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies I've ever seen. Apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time. The only movies that come close to being like all the Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings trilogy or anything by the masters Hitchcock or Spielberg or Tim Burton. These are all good movies and directors but none match up to James Cameron's Masterpiece TITANIC.\", 'Just two comments....SEVEN years apart? Hardly evidence of the film\\'s relentless pulling-power! As has been mentioned, the low-budget telemovie status of 13 GANTRY ROW is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal. Having said that however the thing is not without merit - either as entertainment or as a fright outing per se.<br /><br />True, the plot at its most basic is a re-working of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR - only without much horror. More a case of intrigue! Gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played Halifax -investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the \"house\" as the main suspect. The script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard. It just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments.<br /><br />Having picked the DVD up for a mere $3.95 last week at my regular video store, I cannot begrudge the expenditure. $10.95 would be an acceptable price for the film. Just don\\'t expect fireworks!', \"What's inexplicable? Firstly, the hatred towards this movie. It may not be the greatest movie of all time, but gimme a break, it got 11 oscars for a reason, it made EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS for a reason. It's a damn good movie. Which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it. I have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when I saw it in theaters. I've rewatched it on TV and video, and it had none of the impact it had when I saw it on the big screen (twice, or maybe three times, actually). But that might be it, the appeal of it. It's a Movie, yes, capital M there, it's an Epic, it's a spectacle in the order of Gone With the Wind or Ben Hur. Now, Ben Hur and Gone With the Wind seem kinda hokey to me, with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama. Not that Titanic has none of that. Well, the acting was actually very good. The melodrama was quite heavy-handed at times.<br /><br />But the reason Titanic works is that it's such an emotional ride. I usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind, or give me a visual thrill. This movie isn't exactly dumb, but it's not cerebral at all. The visual thrills are simply means to an end, to fuel the emotions of the audience. I didn't cry when Bambi's mom died, I don't react to tearjerkers. But this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million, an emotional rollercoaster that, if it were a regular one, would make Buzz Aldrin scream like a little girl. And I'm sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it, and have a ready supply of cynicism, then you can thoroughly dislike this movie. But if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit, if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt, you'll enjoy it completely. And look at the top ten grossing films of all time. Is a single one of them bad? Is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10? No, not even The Phantom Menace. And this movie made 1.8 BILLION DOLLARS worldwide. It can't be bad. Not possible. 10/10.<br /><br />p.s. how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman? spiderman was a fun movie, but it was a total 9/11 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did. it simply wasn't anything all that special. no one will remember it in 50 years. but i'm pretty sure Titanic will be remembered.\", 'Previously, I wrote that I loved \"Titanic\", cried at its ending (many times over), and I\\'m a guy in his 60\\'s. I also wondered about why this great movie, which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics, was given only a 7.0 rating by imdb.com users.<br /><br />Well, I looked at the breakdown of the user ratings. While 29.0% of all votes gave it a 10 rating, 10.7% gave it a 1 rating. These 10.7% of these irrational imdb users, in effect, pulled the overall rating down to 7.0. <br /><br />In my previous comments, I blamed this very unusual voting pattern (a sudden surge in 1 ratings, with a high 10 rating, dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level) on only one thing: hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I\\'ve tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people (young men, mostly), who defame him left and right. They absolutely hate the man, and they will have no part in giving him any credit in \"Titanic\". (To answer one other user: I am NOT talking about someone who just really doesn\\'t like the movie that much, and gave it a 5 or a 6, etc. Everyone has, and is entitled to, his/her own taste. But no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7.0 overall for \"Titanic\", pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings, is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture.)<br /><br />Let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of \"Titanic\" to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical \"bombs\" (there are many more, but these 5 will prove my point). \"Heaven\\'s Gate\" (1980) was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing, and imdb voters\\' ratings were: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 ratings (overall rating of 6.1). \"Big Top Pee-wee\" (1988) got 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% 1 ratings (overall rating of 4.5). \"Cat People\" (1982) got 6.1% 10 ratings and 2.6% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.8). \"Blind Date\" (1987) got 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.3). \"Jumpin\\' Jack Flash\" (1986) got 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.2). WHAT DO ALL OF THESE FILMS HAVE IN COMMON WITH \"TITANIC\"? ALL OF THE PERCENTAGES OF THEIR 1 RATINGS ARE LOWER !!!! THAN \"TITANIC\", AND NONE OF THESE STINKERS EVER WAS NOMINATED FOR A SINGLE AWARD. Again, \"Titanic\" got 10.7% 1 ratings! Compare that to the other 5 movies I just mentioned.<br /><br />Can there be any explanation other than the hatred of Leo factor?<br /><br />', \"I loved this movie since I was 7 and I saw it on the opening day. It was so touching and beautiful. I strongly recommend seeing for all. It's a movie to watch with your family by far.<br /><br />My MPAA rating: PG-13 for thematic elements, prolonged scenes of disastor, nudity/sexuality and some language.\", 'The movie Titanic makes it much more then just a \"night to remember.\" It re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten. Why so criticised? I have no idea. Could/will they ever make a movie like Titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it. Could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece. It will be almost impossible.<br /><br />The director no doubt had the major impact on the film. A simple disaster film (boring to watch) converted to an unbelievable romance. Yes I\\'m not the Romance type either, but that should not bother you, because you will never see a romance like this. Guaranteed! Everything to the amazing effects, to the music, to the sublime acting. <br /><br />The movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling. Everything looks very real and live. The legend herself \"TITANIC\" is shown brilliantly in all classes, too looks, too accommodation. The acting was the real effect. Dicaprio and Winslet are simply the best at playing there roles. No one could have done better. They are partly the reason why the film is so great. <br /><br />I guess it\\'s not too much to talk about. The plot is simple, The acting is brilliant, based on a true story, Probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears, thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten. Well if you haven\\'t seen this film your missing out on something Hesterical, and a film to idolise for Hollywood. Could it get better? No. Not at all. The most moving film of all time, don\\'t listen to people, see for yourself then you will understand. A landmark. (don\\'t be surprised if you cry too)', \"I had few problems with this film, and I have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated. True, it is over three hours long, but I was amazed that it goes by so quickly. I don't think it is overrated at all, I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent. The film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. The story is very rich in detail, and is hot on character development, obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be, though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow. The last hour is extremely riveting, and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. The music score by James Horner was lovely, though I never was a huge fan of the song My Heart will Go On. The 1996 miniseries was good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give Titanic an 8.5/10. Bethany Cox.\", 'I think James Cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies. Anyway, everyone remembers the RMS Titanic. It was big, fast, and \"unsinkable\"... until April 1912. It was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever. Well James Cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship. Well, onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film.<br /><br />So our two main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They\\'re not annoying too much but watch this and you\\'ll find out why they could become annoying ( http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn ). The main villain I guess is bad luck, fate, hand of God (no blasphemy intended), or just plain Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Combine all of the above and what do you get?! Oh yes! We get a love story on a sinking boat. The supporting characters are the following: My personal favorite, Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber)(idk he was so nice), Lovejoy(David Warner), Murdoch(Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith(Bernard Hill), Molly Brown(Kathy Bates), and many more. We also got the present day treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They add something to the story, something good. The action in here is awesome, especially in the second half, the drama as also good. In the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears. The story is simple and it works. A treasure hunter seeks the Heart of the Ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond. She calls and tells her tale on the RMS Titanic. Two lovers separated by social class and ultimately, the fate of the ship. Everything about the story works and there are very few flaws. I give Titanic, an 86% awesome', \"Titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship. Writer/Director James Cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the Titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on April 15, 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the North Atlantic. The two leads in the film are great in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make for a good on-screen couple. DiCpario and Winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable. They both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well. The rest of the supporting cast including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film. The love story, the action, suspense, and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time. The horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation. The pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws. Titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it. The fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the Titanic sunk into the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg. Overall Titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill-fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially DiCaprio and Winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch.\", \"The ship may have sunk but the movie didn't!!! Director, James Cameron, from 'The Terminator' did it again with this amazing picture. One of my favorite scenes is 'The Dinner table' scene, in which Rose's family and friends meet Jack after he saves her. Rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet 'THE ONE'...I hope I have that look when I am in the room with my future husband.<br /><br />Jack and Rose have a connection that is 'MOVIE STUFF' but it's good movie stuff. We have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth. Rose almost commits suicide but the Gilbert Grape star rescues her. I really liked the hanging over the boat scene. It was a good risk.<br /><br />The movie is long but it's fantastic!!! Good story, good flow, good actors!!! Go see it twice if you want, Its worth it!!!\", 'Titanic has to be one of my all-time favorite movies. It has its problems (what movies don\\'t) but still, it\\'s enjoyable.<br /><br />When I stumble across someone who asks me why I like Titanic, I suppose my first reaction is \"wait a minute, you don\\'t?\" I know so many people who don\\'t like this movie, and I\\'m not saying I don\\'t see why. \"The love story is too cheesy\" well, yes but isn\\'t it enjoyable and moving? All right, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that love like this doesn\\'t actually exist. But this is a movie, doesn\\'t everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while? The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors. Well, OK, in this movie, I agree that they do not perform to their full potentials. However I think it\\'s unfair to say that they are terrible actors. I personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in. But the roles they are given are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit, but I agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected.<br /><br />And finally, if one is going to complain that they don\\'t like this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then I\\'m sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things. It\\'s like people who complain The Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. Simply for being a movie, not because you dislike the genre, this IS a good movie.<br /><br />Well deserving of its Oscars, in particular, Best Cinematography, which I find to be the best I\\'ve ever seen in a movie save maybe the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br /><br />I know some of the writing fails, such as the constant screaming of each other\\'s names throughout the movie. The flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times, but overall it\\'s an amazing achievement in making the Titanic look so real, and the sinking feel so epic.<br /><br />I understand why a lot of people dislike this movie, but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea, such as it being a love story, rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed.<br /><br />I can tell you that I have read more than five books about the Titanic, including memoirs form the day it happened, and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults. The only main ones I can find is that the piping should be threaded copper, not steel, and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it.<br /><br />I give this movie 10/10, not because I like romance movies, but simply because it\\'s an outstanding cinematic achievement, that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events.', 'Titanic is a classic. I was really surprised that this movie didn\\'t have a solid ten, overall in the IMDb user rankings. Maybe, it\\'s just cool to not give Titanic credit nowadays, but when it was first made it was really something. When the movie came out people flocked to the theaters. When it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month. It was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason. Some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot, like the frozen baby, or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd. Many people died on that ship, and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that James Cameron stepped up to. And let\\'s not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose. Whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone\\'s imagination it was lovely. They barely knew each other, but they would die for each other. They trusted each other. They sure as hell are giving Romeo and Juliet a run for their money. \"I\\'ll never let go, Jack.\" Titanic is a great film down to it\\'s very core. It is a powerful story told through brilliant acting, excellent cinematography, beautiful music, and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers. It really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie.', \"Another Aussie masterpiece, this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural, and it does very well. It doesn't resort to the big special effects overkill like American flicks, it focuses more on emotional impact. A relatively simple plot that Rebecca Gibney & Co. bring to life. It follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside, and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago. Strange things begin to happen in the house, and John Adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared, who was actually a mass murderer. Highly recommended. 8/10\", \"For me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time. No exceptions. James Cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller. Through films such as Aliens, The Abyss and both Terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science-fiction goes. He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film. But Titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance. The film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises, plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows. The story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for Cameron to make a truthful, interesting and entertaining film about it. The acting is wonderful as Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jack and Kate Winslet who plays Rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films I get annoyed when the supporting characters aren't given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is Rose's and Jack's story alone, no one else. Emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home. The music has become iconic and legendary. It is composer James Horner's finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience. The song after so long has become annoying but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is. Only one problem, the usual James Cameron problem, is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside. James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime. My heart won't go on from this one.\", 'Back in 1997, do I remember that year: Clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of Princess Diana, the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I don\\'t think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and didn\\'t watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype? Was it really the best movie of all time? Was that Leonardo\\'s real nose? OK, I know that\\'s silly to say, but I did re-watch the film. Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, best movie of all time, no, just depends on your idea of a good movie, but Titanic delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage.<br /><br />The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean. Unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude, wearing the Heart of the Ocean, dated the day the Titanic sank. 101-year-old Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. She and her granddaughter Elizabeth \"Lizzy\" Calvert visit Lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship. When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic, revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater. In 1912, the upper-class 17-year-old Rose boards the ship with her fiancé, Cal Hockley and her mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater, both of whom stress the importance of Rose\\'s engagement to Cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the Dewitt-Bukater debts: while they have the outward appearance of the upper-class, Rose and her mother are financially broke. Distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling Cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage, Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. Before she leaps, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes. Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first-class formal dinner of the rapport-building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of Irish dance, music and beer in third-class. But after Cal\\'s servant informs him of Rose\\'s whereabouts\\', Rose is forbidden from seeing Jack again. However, after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven-year-old daughter to behave like a \"proper lady\" at tea, Rose defies him and her mother, asking Jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the Heart of the Ocean, an engagement present from Cal. After a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time, they go to the deck of the ship.<br /><br />They then witness the ship\\'s fatal collision with an iceberg. After overhearing the ship\\'s lookouts discussing how serious the collision is, Rose tells Jack they should warn her mother and Cal. Meanwhile, Cal discovers Rose\\'s nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe, so he frames Jack for stealing the Heart of the Ocean by having Lovejoy plant it in Jack\\'s pocket. Upon learning Cal intends to leave Jack to die below deck, Rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him. Jack and Rose return to the top deck. Cal and Jack, though enemies, both want Rose safe, so they persuade her to board a lifeboat. But after realizing that she cannot leave Jack, Rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with Jack in the ship\\'s first class staircase. Jack and Rose return to the top deck, the lifeboats have gone, and the ship finally goes down into the freezing Atlantic taking Jack and Rose down.<br /><br />So does Titanic live up to it\\'s hype? I still say that this is a great movie to watch, I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie. But it has great acting, amazing effects, a well-written story and still looks flawless. Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn\\'t get a lot of hype just because of Leo\\'s baby face or Kate\\'s amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special.

I've seen it more times than I care to count, and I still become transfixed every time, with a feeling which is hard to describe. One for the ages.\", \"Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic. The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense. The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however. Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal (Billy Zane). Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game. If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries. The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.<br /><br />The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the Titanic, which has recently occurred. One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search. She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic. With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding. After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York. Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson. Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned. Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty-two years of experience to stretch the Titanic's legs out to full speed. The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie. On April 15, 1912 at 11:39, an iceberg was sighted. They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film. The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate. The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 2:18 when the lights finally failed. The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanic's many pleas for help. The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own. The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship. Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too. The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking. Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle. Overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.<br /><br />Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship. The core group of Rose, Jack, Cal, and Rose's mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time. Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanic's officers were real. The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smith's last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards. He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaire's Captain when the Titanic sunk. The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol. He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer's former Canadian hometown. As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower-class passengers from non-English speaking nations. In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted. The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss'. Not wanting to leave her husband's side Mrs. Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic. Furthermore, Mr. Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best. The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat. In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water. Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over four-thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke. All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware. The gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs. The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re-creation of the Post-Victorian era of 1912. The rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the women's suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet. Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do. The rich did not take well to `new money' such as Molly Brown as depicted. Everything of the time was very formal. Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes. Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie. Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes. Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society. Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent cross-referencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken. The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.<br /><br />A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise. The director, James Cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people's lives. Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night. In addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990's when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic. Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored. This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed. However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed. There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed. As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.<br /><br />Technically the film is very well done. To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie. In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean. Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship. Furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage. This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner. At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.<br /><br />Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic. Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it doesn't take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture. Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing. If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900's and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you.<br /><br />\", 'I find it so amazing that even after all these years, we are STILL talking about this movie! Obviously this movie wasn\\'t THAT bad or else people wouldn\\'t even BOTHER to talk about it. I personally enjoyed this film immensly, and still do! I guess this film isn\\'t for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many. <br /><br />As for those that think that this film is \"overrated\" or \"over-hyped\"...well, we only have the movie-going public to thank for that! lol* You see, it\\'s not CRITICS/article writers that make a film \"HUGE\" or a \"HIT\" with the general movie-going public. PEOPLE make the film a huge success. With Titanic, everyone was in awe. Let\\'s face it, a film like this had never been made before. At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912. Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched! <br /><br />Give this movie a break you guys! The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time! When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH (which is the BEST form of advertisement mind you) that this was a good/decent/movie worth seeing, then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more! So, I really wouldn\\'t say that this movie was \"overhyped\"...at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being \"overhyped\". ha! Critics didn\\'t even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Cameron\\'s gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film. However, the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more! <br /><br />Personally, I LOVE this film. However, this film might not be for everyone. DOn\\'t say that this film sucks just because of romance though! THat is the most sexist thing I\\'ve ever heard! Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it! The story was sweet. The dialogue could have been better, but let\\'s face it...the REAL star of the movie wasn\\'t Leo or Kate...it was that GIGANTIC Ship! I think all of the actors including DiCaprio and Winslet did a fine job. It\\'s not thier best work (I\\'ve seen much BETTER work from both of them) but it wasn\\'t the WORST I\\'ve seen on screen before. Give them a break!<br /><br />', 'I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. \"It was so great,\" she said. \"You really felt like you were on the ship.\" \"Nonsense,\" I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, \"you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she\\'ll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested.\" \"Well, maybe,\" thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. \"OK,\" I thought, \"I\\'ll give it a look see.\" I didn\\'t want to like it - and I didn\\'t. I loved it! What a great movie.<br /><br />Where to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost \"you are there\" type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don\\'t just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet\\'s being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect \"t\" I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose\\'s mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I\\'m no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion\\'s performance of \"My Heart Goes On.\"<br /><br />Problems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don\\'t accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he\\'s been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats. <br /><br />A minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.<br /><br />9/10', \"To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it? IF you missed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie, that's your loss. The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think. I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most amazing love story ever attempted. I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How lame is that? It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet. I will gladly side with the majority this time around. Okay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, I am done.\", 'Every once in a while the conversation will turn to \"favorite movies.\" I\\'ll mention Titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker. I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by that very movie. And they\\'re too embarrassed now to admit it.<br /><br />I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years. I cried again.... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time. A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people won\\'t even admit they enjoyed it. Folks, let\\'s get something straight -- you don\\'t look cool when you badmouth this film. You look like an out of touch cynic.<br /><br />No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. Wait \\'til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully.<br /><br />James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night. How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. I was utterly transfixed.<br /><br />This film is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow, \"flying\". \"Iceberg, right ahead!\" The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean. The screams of the doomed after she went down. And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.<br /><br />The music, which has also been a victim of the film\\'s success, was a key ingredient. James Horner\\'s score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Too bad Celine Dion\\'s pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.<br /><br />I confess, I am a Titanic buff. As such, I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it -- in all its beauty. Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I\\'ve had such an interest in the ship all my life. However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity.<br /><br />Another reviewer said it better than I ever could: Open up your hearts to Titanic, and you will not be disappointed.', \"I am not a parent, neither am I a male. But I was able to identify with every character's heartaches and pains.<br /><br />This is a movie teenagers should watch. Maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again. I'm sorry for those that don't understand the value of love, family and friendship.<br /><br />It was very interesting to watch Patrick Duffy in a different role than that of Bobby Ewing. And it is great to see a 19 year old Ben Affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance. He showed at an early age, that he is capable of heartfelt drama. He should be offered more serious roles. Note Hollywoodland... his first serious role in years and he went out and won Best Actor at the Venice Festival in 2006.<br /><br />This movie can be appreciated by people of all ages. Maybe shouldn't be watched by children under 10 because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families, but I recommend it to the entire family.<br /><br />I bought this movie on DVD and have watched it with friends many times. Because it portrays the values that are important in life.\", 'After a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted, urban, turn of the century Australian street, we meet Julie (Rebecca Gibney) and Peter (John Adam) as they go out house hunting. They manage to get a loan for a fixer-upper on a posh Sydney street, but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home. It just may be haunted.<br /><br />13 Gantry Row combines a memorable if somewhat clichéd story with good to average direction by Catherine Millar into a slightly above average shocker.<br /><br />The biggest flaws seem partially due to budget, but not wholly excusable to that hurdle. A crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film. The opening \"thriller scene\" features some wonky editing. Freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there\\'s not much action. Suspense should be created from staging, not fancy \"fix it in the mix\" techniques. There is great atmosphere in the scene from the location, the lighting, the fog and such, but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim, cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street, showing their increasing proximity. The tracking and the cuts need to be slow. The attack needed to be longer, clearer and better blocked. As it stands, the scene has a strong \"made for television\" feel, and a low budget one at that.<br /><br />After this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves. The story has a lot of similarities to The Amityville Horror (1979), though the budget forces a much subtler approach. Millar and scriptwriter Tony Morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios, often dramatic in nature instead of special effects-oriented, such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron, which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall.<br /><br />For some horror fans, the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama. At least the first half hour of the film is primarily about Julie and Peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in. But Morphett writes fine, intelligent dialogue. The material is done well enough that it\\'s often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later--especially if you\\'ve gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house.<br /><br />Once they get settled and things begin to get weirder, even though the special effects often leave much to be desired, the ideas are good. The performances help create tension. There isn\\'t an abundance of death and destruction in the film--there\\'s more of an abundance of home repair nightmares. But neither menace is really the point.<br /><br />The point is human relationships. There are a number of character arcs that are very interesting. The house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it. That it\\'s in a posh neighborhood, and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies, shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe, such as money or health problems. Peter\\'s character evolves from a striving corporate employee with \"normal\" work-based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive, scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful. At the same time, we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be. Julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown, but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship.<br /><br />Although 13 Gantry Row never quite transcends its made-for-television clunkiness, as a TV movie, this is a pretty good one, with admirable ambitions. Anyone fond of haunted house films, psycho films or horror/thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy. It certainly isn\\'t worth spending $30 for a DVD (that was the price my local PBS station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it (factoring in shipping and handling)), but it\\'s worth a rental, and it\\'s definitely worth watching for free.', 'Daniell Steel\\'s Daddy, what a refreshing story. This movie glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children. How rare is that? In these times of \"Heather has two Mommies\" (or what ever, you fill in the blanks) it is easy to see why this theme is not for everyone. With the father\\'s roles being prominent I was hoping this would be another Daniell Steel Saga. How disappointing to have it end. Every character was important and did a fabulous job carrying their role. I would have loved to see each character develop over the years. I loved this movie, it is one I will defiantly watch every time it\\'s on. Good story, good acting, and I hope this isn\\'t a spoiler, but no obtrusive sex or bad language. Yes it touched my heart. Warning, get the Kleenex ready. What I find sad is that this side of family life is rarely depicted today in our entertainment, be it Television or. Movie\\'s. Daniell if your listening, You Go Girl, give us more.', 'Family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about. Love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about. One man, Daddy, has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity. The kids grow up,one all be it, in the hard way, to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is, the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall. ALL the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances. Yes, I shed a tear along the way knowing I had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent. This true to life is one which every young adult, and parent, would do well to see, although some will not realize it until they too are parents. A must see for those who care about their families.', 'It\\'s heart-warming to see a movie that doesn\\'t bash males. In this one the wife/mother leaves her family to \"get in touch\" with herself - or pursue her libido. The father stays with and nurtures the kids, letting neither his work nor his love life interfere with his love of and responsibility to them.', 'I must admit, when I read the description of the genre on Netflix as \"Steamy Romance\" I was a little bit skeptical. \"Steamy\"? In a movie from 1968?? I was prepared for disappointment. And when I realized it was shot entirely in black & white, I knew my erotic hopes were dashed.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong! Not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance -- the discovery of first love, fear of the secret being found out, a sudden unexpected end -- but at times this movie was downright erotic. You will soon forget that it is shot in black & white. The cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years. And the performances from the two stars (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) are intense and memorable. OK, so they\\'re both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls. It\\'s 1968. Do you really expect teenagers from the \\'60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this? Many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then. Anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much.<br /><br />I think this movie was way ahead of its time. The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure; yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination, opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown.<br /><br />I have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here. As for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action: Although it won\\'t be all you expect, I don\\'t think you\\'ll be too, too disappointed.', 'This is a film.., not porn.<br /><br />This is a wonderful film!!!

This is a movie for the whole family despite its rating. This is a movie I will show to my children. The professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women, but this movie was more than that. It is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite.\", 'I was going to bed with my gf last night, and while she was brushing her teeth, I flipped channels until I came across this Chinese movie called the King of Masks. At first I thought it was going to be a Kung Fu movie, so I started watching it, and then it immediately captured me in, and I had to finish it.<br /><br />The little girl in the movie was absolutely adorble. She was such a great actor for being so little. Maybe the fact it was in Chinese, so the English was dubbed made it harder for me to tell...but she really seemed to be in character perfectly. I felt so bad for the girl as she kept trying to please her \"boss\" but everything just turned out rotten. lol. Even when she brings him another grandson, just so he can pass on his art...it turns out that kid was kidnapped, so he gets arrested and has 5 days to live. lol...whatever she touches in an effort to be nice to her grandpa, just backfires.<br /><br />In the end, he sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of masks...which is just so heartwarming after all the mishaps in the movie.<br /><br />Definitely a gem, and totally original.<br /><br />Scott', 'I admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of his/her reluctant guardian. I\\'ve seen enough of them \\x97 Baby Boom, Kolya, About a Boy, Mostly Martha, and to some extent, Whale Rider \\x97 to expect to be bored by the formula. What held my attention in The King of Masks was the grimness of the setting: small-town China in the 1930\\'s. Extreme poverty was the norm, and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market. When Wang discovers his purchased grandson, whom he\\'s nicknamed \"Doggie,\" is a granddaughter, he initially casts her out, even though she\\'s showed great promise as street-performing heir. Even after he reluctantly takes her back, he\\'s not too upset when she\\'s kidnapped. The film is gritty then, showing the lengths to which a young, street-smart girl had to go to survive in that society.<br /><br />The two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context. In a Western society, one would expect at least a hint of resentment from Wang at not having achieved more material success. Wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status, though, that I did, too. While Doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern, suburban child, it\\'s completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage. And after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her, her fierce attachment to Wang makes perfect sense.<br /><br />The peek at small-town life in a foreign country, the naturalness of the two lead actors, the surprising plot twists, and of course, the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film.', 'This movie is the best film ever. I can\\'t remember the last time a movie has drawn tears out of me. with a tear in my eye, I admire this movie. It has all the elements that a good movie must have: Excellent Dialogues, Music, Acting, Story/Plot. A story of friendship, courage, kindliness and loyalty between a Street performing who famous to The King of Masks and a little girl that sold as a boy in serf bazaar. Little girl liked to be his granddaughter and King of Masks liked a grandson. They were not conventional in real. Every scene they were together was priceless. The camera work is flawless and grips you. The acting is inspired. Xu Zhu was Excellent as The King of Masks. Renying Zhou \"Doggie\" looks pretty and played her character very well. Zhigang Zhao as Liang Sao Lang was great. He played his helpful and kindhearted character extremely well. If you have\\'t this movie, try it once, Do watch it.', \"Verhoeven's movie was utter and complete garbage. He's a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed. By his own admission, he read 2 chapters of the book, got bored, and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch.<br /><br />Heinlein would have NEVER supported that trash if he'd been alive to see it. It basically steals the name, mocks politics of the book (which is a good portion of it), and throws in some T&A so the average idiot American moviegoer doesn't get bored.<br /><br />This anime isn't perfect, but it's at least mostly accurate, as best I can tell.\", \"Wang Bianlian is an old street performer who is known as a 'King of masks' for his mastery of Sichuan change art. Liang is a famous opera performer of Sichuan art and respects Wang as an artist and as a person. Liang is worried that a precious art shouldn't die with Wang and so he sows the seed of an heir in to Wang's mind. The film is about prejudices, male domination, state of art, values and most importantly warmth.<br /><br />I can't recommend this film enough. The whole film is in loops. Everything has a significance. Its a long story which has been edited so well that the length of the film is just 91 minutes. A total satisfaction. For five minutes it is an artistic film, next five minutes its a sad film, next five minutes its a thriller. It just keeps changing its mood like its protagonist changes his face. Last scene on the rope is phenomenal. Story and script is flawless. Actors are brilliant. Both the protagonists are artists you can tell the way they have performed. Very impressive. It was not even nominated for Oscars. That year 'English patient' got the best film Oscar and in the foreign film category 'Kolya' won. 'Kolya' was just OK and about 'English patient' the lesser said the better. Watch it 9/10.\", \"One of the most heart-warming foreign films I've ever seen.<br /><br />The young girl is an amazing talent. Stellar performances by her (Doggie), the old man (the king of masks), and Liang (the Living Boddhisatva).<br /><br />(SPOILER) The deplorable treatment of children, especially females is disturbing.<br /><br />Loved the music. The original Chinese dialog heightens the emotional intensity of the performances and the story.<br /><br />This is a MUST SEE -- enjoyable family film, although not for very young children. Would have rated the DVD release even higher if the soundtrack had been transferred better onto the DVD and the transfer had included the widescreen version.\", 'Wow. What a wonderful film. The script is nearly perfect it appears this is the only film written by Minglun Wei,I hope he has more stories in him.<br /><br />The acting is sublime. Renying Zhou as Doggie was amazing -- very natural talent, and Xu Zhu was a delight - very believable as the jaded old traditionalist. <br /><br />The soundtrack was very effective, guiding without being overwhelming. <br /><br />If only more movies like this were made whether in Hollywood or Hong Kong- a family friendly, well acted, well written, well directed, near perfect gem.', \"The filming is pleasant and the environment is keenly realistic. I liked that it boldly redresses conceptions of the many difficult moral and social morays of the 1930's Chinese-mainland countryside as well as more basic human questions - I felt I could get a real sense of the times, recreated even in splendid shots of traditional Chinese theatre and in purist depictions of street living. It seemed worthwhile to experience. The interwoven role which Buddhism plays is probably the most true-to-form - both in its menial and in its philosophic aspect, perhaps the most effective that I've seen in Chinese film. Casting is great. Images are memorable. Acting is solid enough. Thematically puerile but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of its expression.\", \"The King of Masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship. Set in 1930s China during a time of floods, we meet Wang, an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the awe of all who witness him. When a famous operatic performer sees and then befriends Wang, he invites Wang to join their troupe. However, we learn that Wang's family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son. Learning that Wang is childless, Wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever. Taking the advice to heart, Wang purchases an 8 year old to fulfill his legacy; he would teach his new son, Doggie, the ancient art of silk masks. Soon, Wang discovers a fact about Doggie that threatens the rare and dying art.<br /><br />Together, Wang and Doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it. The story is absorbing. The setting is serene and the costuming simple. Summarily, it is an International Award winning art film which can't help but to move and inspire.\", \"This is a superb movie, suitable for all but the very youngest, though accessibility for younger people was marred (at least in the print which I saw) by the use of some unfortunate choice of English sub-titling! For much of the film it is almost impossible to guess in which time-period it is set - there is no modern technology shown, not even the ubiquitous Chinese bicycle, just a drab, almost monochrome, everyday life, against which is contrasted the dazzling display of the Sezuan Opera and of celebratory fireworks. Even when a group of soldiers refer to their imminent departure for a theatre of war, this could still be any time in the past 150 years.<br /><br />But then we briefly see a motor car - late 30s, early 40s style - and we realise that we are watching a China on the verge of huge upheavals, and that much of the world we are seeing is about to be swept away in the cataclysm of World War 2 and the Communist revolution.<br /><br />Which makes the central character's desire to adhere to old customs and traditions all the more poignant.<br /><br />But the film also raises issues which are of vital importance even today, both within China and in other parts of the world: the inequality between boys and girls, men and women; the trade, for various purposes, in young children; corruption in society; injustice; the importance of friendship.<br /><br />Maybe I'm reading too much into this film; but I don't think so! I also think that it is a scandal that films of this calibre are often not shown in the United Kingdom, whilst dross is passed off as quality material.<br /><br />But don't get me started on that...\", \"King of Masks (Bian Lian in China) is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film. Winner of 16 awards from around the world, this film based on a true story centers on Wang Bianlian, a street performer in 1930s China who is growing older but has no heir to pass on his art of face-change opera. He has a unique talent of quickly changing masks in performance, and no one knows how he does it. He has a longing desire to have a grandson, as his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir. We then go to the streets, and see that people are selling their children because they can't afford to take care of them: some are even begging to take their daughters for free, because daughters are not worth much in this society. Wang Bianlian's story goes on from there.<br /><br />The film was so astonishingly good, the acting was amazing, and the issues were so weighty and well-addressed. There is the gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this time and place, no one wants a little girl. Also interesting to note is that the famed opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the Living Bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman, and while he is famous and well-respected, he regards himself as something low, a half woman. As we go further into the film, the face the issues of human slave trade and its demand and thus the lack of a possible solution for it, the brutality and corruption of the military and police, and the helplessness and lack of power any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions.<br /><br />This is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life, and Xu Zhu, the actor who plays Wang Bianlian, presents yet another beautiful performance.\", 'This is how movies are supposed to be made: a fascinating setting; characters about whom you come to care deeply; writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense. This is a wonderful film -- deeply moving without being sentimental. Highly recommended.', 'This movie was excellent. A sad truth to how culture tends to clash with the sexes. This is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie. You have the master who is steeped in tradition and kind hearted in his own way, Doggie despite being a girl thing to win his affections and you top it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions. This equals on big happy movie in the end. This movie does a good job at showing how steeped in tradition one can be, so steeped that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets. You see sides to a culture never seen before which helps enhance the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture. The cinema-photography is excellent, in particular the opening parade sequence with all the sparkers. Bound to be in Oscar contention for best foreign film.', \"This movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone, but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation. Women and performers (both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star) are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in China. This makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors' performance.<br /><br />A welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies.\", \"Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel Starship Troopers has been messed around with in recent years, in everything to Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film to a TV series, to a number of games. But none of these, so to speak, has really captured the spirit of his novel. The games are usually unrelated, the TV series was more of a spin off, and the less said about Verhoeven's film, the better. Little do most know, however, that in Japan, an animated adaptation had already been done, released the year of Heinlein's death. And, believe it or not, despite its differences, this 6-part animated series is, plot-wise, the most faithful adaptation of Heinlein's classic.<br /><br />The most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons, something we were deprived of in Verhoeven's film. Like the book, the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel, though we see a fair amount of each. While events happen differently than in the book, the feel of the book's plot is present. Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement, but it's only slightly more touched upon than in the book. While some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book (it gets a bit of the anime treatment, but what did you expect?), but it's far superior to the film. Heinlein's political views are merely excised, as opposed to the film, where they are reversed. The big payoff of the series, however, is the climatic battle on Klendathu between the troopers and the bugs/aliens, which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to that of Heinlein. And I think they did pretty well with this. If you can find this series, give it a look.\", \"As I was watching this film on video last night, I kept getting these tingles that told me this one will endure. I've a feeling I'll be watching this again and again for years to come.<br /><br />It's got all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a story/film. And even though some cultural references are obscure for me, a Western viewer, at the core this is a universal tale.\", 'When tradition dictates that an artist must pass his great skills and magic on to an heir, the aging and very proud street performer, known to all as \"The King of Masks,\" becomes desperate for a young man apprentice to adopt and cultivate.<br /><br />His warmth and humanity, tho, find him paying a few dollars for a little person displaced by China\\'s devastating natural disasters, in this case, massive flooding in the 1930\\'s.<br /><br />He takes his new, 7 year old companion, onto his straw houseboat, to live with his prized and beautiful monkey, \"General,\" only to discover that the he-child is a she-child.<br /><br />His life is instantly transformed, as the love he feels for this little slave girl becomes entwined in the stupifying tradition that requires him to pass his art on only to a young man.<br /><br />There are many stories inside this one...many people are touched, and the culture of China opens itself for our Western eye to observe. Thousands of years of heritage boil down into a teacup of drama, and few will leave this DVD behind with a dry eye.<br /><br />The technical transfer itself is not that great, as I found the sound levels all over the meter, and could actually see the video transfer lines in several parts of the movie. Highly recommended :-) 9/10 stars.', 'An unexpected pleasure as I had heard nothing about this film.<br /><br />Shameful since it warrants having a wider audience.<br /><br />A wonderfully humane story with a social message gently told, although admittedly predictable in its resolution. Solidly acted by the principals. Beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against grey that captures the nostalgic tone of the film.<br /><br />My recent foray into Chinese film (Shower, The Road Home, Not One Less) has been an exciting one that I hope to continue exploring. China and its people is an amazing canvas for film-makers. \"The King of Masks\" can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in recent Chinese film.<br /><br />', \"One of the great things about many of the superb Chinese movies you can find, if you are lucky, in the video stores, is they are very accurate retellings of actual, true stories. Farewell, my Concubine, The Emperor and the Assassin and this movie are perfect examples. The film makers take a true story and work hard to accurately create a movie without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience -- the hallmark of much Hollywood, and especially Disney films.<br /><br />In this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the King of Masks for his mastery of Sichuan Change Art. Along an having lost his only son many years earlier, he searches to find a male heir to carry on his rare and dying art in a society that forbids females to have such work. Master Wang is sold a son by a slave trader. All is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art. But the son eventually is found out to be a girl. From there, the story get very interesting, with a good performance by Master Liang of the Sichuan Opera -- a regional operatic style related to Peking Opera. Fans of Farewell My Concubine should look carefully at Master Liang's portrayal of a male playing the female role in Chinese Opera. It may help them come to understand that the players of these female roles were probably not homosexuals or castrati, but people who have be so psychologically conditioned as to be totally unaware of their own sexuality.\", 'quote by Nicolas Martin (nicmart) from Houston, TX: \"Fine film, but DVD \"reformatted for TV\", 8 April 2002 - This is a charming and emotive film. On the other hand, the DVD I purchased has been \"reformatted to fit your TV\" by the clods at Columbia Tristar. There is no excuse for not providing the film in widescreen format, except that Hollywood treats all films like the moronic, disposable trash that it is so used to producing. What a shame.\"<br /><br />What a (criminal!) shame indeed. However, there is another version out though. See here for details http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDCompare2/kingofmasks.htm<br /><br />Wonderful performances by the two main actors (The King and Doggie) BTW.', '\"Masks\" is a moving film that works on many levels. At its simplest, it is the haunting story of a street performer who bonds with a young child while trying to pass along his creative art (masks) to the next generation. Although, at times the story makes the old man into a Job, it is so well crafted (written, acted, directed, wonderful production values), it is easy to move beyond his plight. And, if you hang with it, the film is ultimately very sweet and uplifting. Kudos all around. This is a wonderful film for children as well as adults. The trick is how to get Americans who may not like foreign language films to see it!', 'Beautiful and touching movie. Rich colors, great settings, good acting and one of the most charming movies I have seen in a while. I never saw such an interesting setting when I was in China. My wife liked it so much she asked me to log on and rate it so other would enjoy too.', \"This is probably my favorite movie of all time. It is perfection in its storytelling. It will break your heart not because it's over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters go through. You feel for Doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in China at that time.\", \"It's a tale that could have taken place anywhere really, given the right circumstances. Street entertainer catching the attention of famous opera star and friendship ensuing. The aging entertainer finds/buys a male child to pass his art to. From there, we follow them through the rigors of their challenging, but free life along the river. Traveling town to town, he performs and has some degree of notoriety. Despite the times and the influences, the man is kind and good.<br /><br />Overall, the performances are first rate, especially Xu Zhu, who portrays the street performer. The child (Renying Zhou) is beautiful, and downright strong, and withstands the overt prejudices well. The two protagonists, along with supporting help from the kind opera singer, Master Liang (an interestingly androgynous Zhao Zhigang), paint a very interesting tale of forgiveness, sadness and love. Some have mentioned this film's remote similarities to BA WANG BIE JI (FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE); yet this film can't stand easily on its own, any resemblance is remote at best.<br /><br />My only qualm with the KING OF MASKS, is the ending. It was weak, cliche and about as subtle as a sledgehammer. The audience was already wrapped up in the story, what was the needless manipulation for? What a shame. To bring a fine motion picture that far, only to surrender to emotional (and corny) pathos like that. It frankly made this film good, instead of the classic, it should've been. That aside, the KING OF MASKS is still very well worth your time. I was happy to see the Shaw Brothers are still producing good films. Highly recommended.\", 'I enjoyed the cinematographic recreation of China in the 1930s in this beautiful film. The story is simple. An older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man although he has no living children. The faces of the actors are marvelous to see. The story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well. The operas in the film remind me of FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, which was more sophisticated and intricate. The story here reminds me of a Dickens tale of days when children were almost chattel. The plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the heroism, humanity, and history portrayed.', \"OK, let's get this clear. I'm really not into sci-fi, but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1. <br /><br />Jack O'Neil takes his team SG-1 through a Stargate. A round device that creates a wormhole. It gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds. It might sound like your usual sci-fi-series, but it's not! The plot is set today not in some distant millennium like many other sci-fi-series. I find that great. It gives you things, happenings and such you can relate to, and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets. They have some of course but thanks to O'Neil who likes to keep a simple terminology, there's not many. <br /><br />The series has a nice blending of action, humor and drama. If you enjoy loads of special effects you're not going to find it here. They don't use many bad ones but a limited amount of well made special effects.\", \"In the rapid economic development of 1990's in China, there is a resurgence of traditional Chinese culture, partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth, and more importantly, due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post Cultural-Revolutionary era.<br /><br />However, the resurgence of Chinese traditional culture, namely, the Confucianism, was not without disasters, because Chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part, and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example.<br /><br />Moreover, not only the part that should be discarded were inherited, the good part that was supposed to be inherited, such as the traditional opera, and its technique, such as changing face, was ignored in the resurgence, and facing extinction.<br /><br />The director used this film to criticize the problem of re-embracing tradition by contemporary China and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie.\", \"This is a beautiful, rich, and very well-executed film with a rich and meaningful story. Basically, it tells how an old master story teller needs to find a (male) heir to carry on his craft, but ends up not getting what he expected in his very male-dominated world. The characters must then deal with their situation and the old master must grapple with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and his and society's traditional notions.<br /><br />The story is fun, emotional, and complex. The exploration of the characters, their lives, and emotions, is rich and compelling the character development is strong while the characters are complex and not one dimensional at all. The film expertly conveys the old man's emotions and his desire to find an heir, and compellingly shows how he and the kid handle the situation. There is also humour, sometimes quite subtle, at appropriate points. The film also examines the good and bad of traditional Chinese culture, creating further interest and depth to the film.<br /><br />The directing, acting, and scenery are all outstanding. Added to the other strengths, this creates rich and convincing visual images and compelling, real characters. As a result, the film evokes strong empathy for, and feelings about, the characters.<br /><br />Some have claimed that the ending weakens the film, but I do not necessarily agree. Perhaps it could have been stronger with a different ending, but any improvement in the overall film would have been rather small.\", \"The movie is truly poignant, unique and uplifting. The story is universal in that it's a battle between good, evil and the world between. THE MOST IMPORTANT thing is that its rating is wrong, misleading, and a travesty. Blockbuster has it rated as though it were an X rated movie. The truth is is that it is closer to G than PG and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple sub-titles.\", 'The fact that this film was put out on DVD still formatted-to TV and with a fuzzy picture really annoyed a lot of film purists......and rightly so. This deserves a lot better treatment.<br /><br />The story is about a street performer who needs a son to pass on his craft (the rules of the day) and winds up with a little girl instead (not the conventional way) ....and the problems that ensue afterward. The old man had bought the kid at a slave auction and soon discovers the kid is not a boy, which he obviously thought was the case.<br /><br />The old man \"Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu)is kind of funny-looking with a missing front tooth and an infectious grin.

You truly see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film.

inspector im here to sack one of your teachers student welcome to bromwell high i expect that many adults of my age think that bromwell high is far fetched what a pity that it isnt', 'homelessness or houselessness as george carlin stated has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school work or vote for the matter most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism the war on iraq pressuring kids to succeed technology the elections inflation or worrying if theyll be next to end up on the streets but what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home the entertainment sets a bathroom pictures on the wall a computer and everything you once treasure to see what its like to be homeless that is goddard bolts lesson mel brooks who directs who stars as bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival jeffery tambor to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries if bolt succeeds he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings the bets on where bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he cant step off the sidewalk hes given the nickname pepto by a vagrant after its written on his forehead where bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of molly lesley ann warren an ex dancer who got divorce before losing her home and her pals sailor howard morris and fumes teddy wilson who are already used to the streets theyre survivors bolt isnt hes not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where its fight or flight kill or be killed while the love connection between molly and bolt wasnt necessary to plot i found life stinks to be one of mel brooks observant films where prior to being a comedy it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as blazing saddles young frankenstein or spaceballs for the matter to show what its like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they dont know what to do with their money maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like monopoly money or maybe this film will inspire you to help others', 'brilliant over acting by lesley ann warren best dramatic hobo lady i have ever seen and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none the corn on face is a classic as good as anything in blazing saddles the take on lawyers is also superb after being accused of being a turncoat selling out his boss and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently im a lawyer he says three funny words jeffrey tambor a favorite from the later larry sanders show is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto his character is more malevolent than usual the hospital scene and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site are all time classics look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting one bleeds this movie gets better each time i see it which is quite often', 'this is easily the most underrated film inn the brooks cannon sure its flawed it does not give a realistic view of homelessness unlike say how citizen kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers or titanic gave a realistic view of italians you idiots many of the jokes fall flat but still this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive its not the fisher king but its not crap either my only complaint is that brooks should have cast someone else in the lead i love mel as a director and writer not so much as a lead', 'this is not the typical mel brooks film it was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable leslie ann warren made the movie she is such a fantastic under rated actress there were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so but all in all this is worth the price to rent and see it the acting was good overall brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience again warren was the best actor in the movie but fume and sailor both played their parts well', 'this isnt the comedic robin williams nor is it the quirky insane robin williams of recent thriller fame this is a hybrid of the classic drama without over dramatization mixed with robins new love of the thriller but this isnt a thriller per se this is more a mystery suspense vehicle through which williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeper also starring sandra oh and rory culkin this suspense drama plays pretty much like a news report until williams character gets close to achieving his goal i must say that i was highly entertained though this movie fails to teach guide inspect or amuse it felt more like i was watching a guy williams as he was actually performing the actions from a third person perspective in other words it felt real and i was able to subscribe to the premise of the story all in all its worth a watch though its definitely not friday saturday night fare it rates a 77 10 from the fiend ', 'yes its an art to successfully make a slow paced thriller the story unfolds in nice volumes while you dont even notice it happening fine performance by robin williams the sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film however the core plot is very engaging the movie doesnt rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering the direction is good use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good very nice 1 time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story', 'in this critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events gabriel robin williams a celebrated writer and late night talk show host becomes captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother toni collette when troubling questions arise about this boys story however gabriel finds himself drawn into a widening mystery that hides a deadly secret\\x85 according to films official synopsis you really should stop reading these comments and watch the film now the how did he lose his leg ending with ms collette planning her new life should be chopped off and sent to deleted scenes land its overkill the true nature of her physical and mental ailments should be obvious by the time mr williams returns to new york possibly her blindness could be in question   but a revelation could have be made certain in either the highway or video tape scenes the film would benefit from a re editing   how about a directors cut  williams and bobby cannavale as jess dont seem initially believable as a couple a scene or two establishing their relationship might have helped set the stage otherwise the cast is exemplary williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization and not a gay impersonation sandra oh as anna joe morton as ashe and rory culkin pete logand are all perfect best of all collettes donna belongs in the creepy hall of fame ms oh is correct in saying collette might be you know like that guy from psycho there have been several years when organizations giving acting awards seemed to reach for women due to a slighter dispersion of roles certainly they could have noticed collette with some award consideration she is that good and director patrick stettner definitely evokes hitchcock   he even makes getting a sandwich from a vending machine suspenseful finally writers stettner armistead maupin and terry anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants

culkin joe morton sandra oh john cullum lisa emery becky ann baker dir patrick stettner  hitchcockian suspenser gives williams a stand out low key performance what is it about celebrities and fans what is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm  in the latest derange fan scenario based on true events no less williams stars as a talk radio personality named gabriel no one who reads stories hes penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named pete logand culkin who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to no ones editor ashe morton who gives it to no one to read for himself  no one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named donna collette giving an excellent performance who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with no one reveals that pete is dying from aids naturally no one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover jess cannavale whose sudden departure from their new york city apartment has no one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into donna and petes backgrounds discovering some truths that he didnt anticipate written by armistead maupin who co wrote the screenplay with his former lover terry anderson and the films novice director stettner and based on a true story about a fans hoax found out has some hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned pot boiler does it helps that williams gives a stand out low key performance as the conflicted good hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him the one thing that has escaped his own reality and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy collette whose one physical trait i will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the core however the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by stettner it pays to listen to your own inner voice be careful of what you hope for', 'you know robin williams god bless him is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade with perhaps the exception of death to smoochy which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic the dramas he has made lately have been fantastic especially insomnia and one hour photo the night listener despite mediocre reviews and a quick dvd release is among his best work period this is a very chilling story even though it doesnt include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed in high school i read an autobiography by a child named anthony godby johnson who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted aids as a result i was moved by the story until i read reports online that johnson may not actually exist when i saw this movie the confused feelings that robin williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind toni collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic caretaker her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like little miss sunshine there were even times she looked into the camera where i thought she was staring right at me it takes a good actress to play that sort of role and its this understated yet well reviewed role that makes toni collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award as of 2008 its incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this and its scary too this is a good dark film that i highly recommend be prepared to be unsettled though because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end', 'when i first read armistead maupins story i was taken in by the human drama displayed by gabriel no one and those he cares about and loves that being said we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of hollywood writer armistead maupin and director patrick stettner have truly succeeded  with just the right amount of restraint robin williams captures the fragile essence of gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel lifejess and the world around himdonna as we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably the request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward its to bad that most people will avoid this film i only say that because the average american will probably think robin williams in a serious role that didnt work before please give this movie a chance robin williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people like his movie one hour photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art oh and before i forget i believe bobby cannavale as jess steals every scene he is in he has the 1940s leading man looks and screen presence its this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now s~', 'i liked the film some of the action scenes were very interesting tense and well done i especially liked the opening scene which had a semi truck in it a very tense action scene that seemed well done some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time lapse photography unusual colors or interesting angles also the film is funny is several parts i also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too id give the film an 8 out of 10', 'there are many illnesses born in the mind of man which have been given life in modern times constant vigilance or accrued information in the realm of pyschosis have kept psychologists counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last them decades occasionally some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their remedy or even of their existence that is the premise of the film entitled  the night listner it tells the story of a popular radio host called gabriel noon robin williams who spends his evenings enthralling his audiences with vivid stories about gay lifestyles perhaps its because his show is losing its authentic veneer which causes noon to admit he is no longer himself feeling abandoned by both his lover jess bobby cannavale and his and best friend joe morton he seeks shelter in his deepening despair and isolation it is here a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help noon needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a 14 year old boy called peter rory culkin in reading the boys harrowing manuscript which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents noon is captivated and wants to help however things are not what they seem and noon soon finds himself en wrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare this movie is pure robin williams and were it not for toni collette who plays donna d logand sandra oh as anna and john cullum as pop this might be comical instead this may prove to be one of williams more serious performances ***', 'i enjoyed the night listener very much its one of the better movies of the summer robin williams gives one of his best performances in fact the entire cast was very good all played just the right notes for their characters   not too much and not too little sandra oh adds a wonderful comic touch toni collette is great as the mom and never goes over the top everyone is very believable its a short movie just under an hour and a half i noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the sundance version i wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie the director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads it is not a hitchcockian thriller see the night listener because you want to see a good story told well if you go expecting hitchcock you will be disappointed my only complaint with the movie was the ending the director could have left a little more to the audiences imagination but this is a minor quibble', 'the night listener is probably not one of williams best roles but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie i can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before some people maybe wont like the slow pacing of this movie but i think its the great plus of the movie it is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year 2006 it has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content dramatic feeling this is no americanized movie neither is it a predictable movie you just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be this is no excellent movie that has everything but hell its a damn good and very original movie', 'like one of the previous commenters said this had the foundations of a great movie but something happened on the way to delivery such a waste because collettes performance was eerie and williams was believable i just kept waiting for it to get better i dont think it was bad editing or needed another director it could have just been the film it came across as a canadian movie something like the first few seasons of x files not cheap just hokey also it needed a little more suspense something that makes you jump off your seat the movie reached that moment then faded away kind of like a false climax i can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away from the reality of the story but i thought that part was reached when gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy this movie needs to have a directors cut that tries to fix these problems', 'the night listener held my attention with robin williams shining as a new york city radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a 14 year old boy rory culkin who is very ill williams has never met the boy in person as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone however williams ex boyfriend nice job from bobby cannavale raises doubt about the boy which prompts williams to arrange a meeting with him in person what follows makes a permanent impact on williams in a way he does not expect i will leave it at that toni collette also stars i enjoyed this film with toni collette giving a memorable portrayal of culkins adoptive mother sandra oh also starred as williams friend the night listener is inspired by actual events and it has a somber almost creepy silence throughout at times it is predictable no thanks to some of the reviews i read before seeing the movie and just due to logic but i liked it anyway i enjoy williams in roles like this more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me recommended 8 10', 'popular radio storyteller gabriel no onerobin williamsscraggy and speaking in

of this genre would run thats good in that it keeps the action and storyline lean and clear its bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and doesnt sew up any of the plot openings or back story id rather not go into any great detail except to say thatif you are not familiar with mrmaupins works or his personal storyyou feel a little bit out of the loop here stillthe performances by williams

part she hasare top notch and the mood established here  namelythe chillylonely dark exteriors of wisconsin and new york  give a terrific framing for this story it may have ends that dont tie together particularly wellbut its still a compelling enough story to stick with', 'if there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing the premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about however there is not much tension and williams mild mannered portrayal doesnt do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy collete fares much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear the production felt rushed and holes are apparent it certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort the book is probably better one thing is certain taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort', 'i absolutely loved this film i do not at all relate to all the other comments i have read about it i was completely enthralled through every second  i found the story gripping the acting intense and the direction spot on i would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie even though there was nothing scary about the story itself i was soundly on edge through the whole movie   and for the rest of my evening  i found that there were so many perfect choices madethe casting the script the little bits of humor sprinkled in it there were so many points where the film couldve gone for the cheap thrill but it never did and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out latelyand for the last number of years', 'this night listener is better than people are generally saying it has weaknesses and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis no doubt but i think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this the whole thing feels like one of those fireside this happened to a friend of a friend of mine ghost stories one big complaint about the movie is the pacing but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility and real life just sort of plods along\\x97no so there are no flashy endings or earth shattering revelations no showdown scenes thank heaven you have to get into the zone when watching this movie forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a conventionallygood movie williams isnt terrific but he easily meets the needs of the story plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic no one as he is the everyman the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story toni collettes performance should be nominated for an oscar even if she maybe shouldnt win it give it a shot for quality and content alone the night listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days', 'when it comes to movies i can be pretty picky and ill complain about anything and everything that is done wrong while every movie has its flaws the night listener had an exceptionally low count if you read the last review it was hard since half of it was written in caps and it contained no actual information about the movie you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done unfortunately if you read more than 3 lines into that same review you discovered the posters reason for disdain he she does not like the fact that the director is gay or that the production team smokes crackapparently so despite the fact that i have never written a review before i thought this movie deserved one based on its merits not the sexual orientation of its director lets go over a quick checklist first 1 great plot absolutely i wont give a shred of it away but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials this is a thriller not a horror and it should be approached as such the story really will amaze you even more so because its true and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual events 2 wonderful acting oh yes robin williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy type cast and he has since flourished in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off just a decade ago he once again achieves high form in his role in the night listener playing a radio host who becomes increasingly troubled by and entangled in a case ofwell ill let you see for yourself 3 excellent direction certainly now unlike the other poster to which i referred i actually know something about direction ive been sutdying the art of direction at school now for 3 years of course i really dont think that makes a lick of difference the only thing that matters is if you like the direction but i thought i should simply establish once again that im basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevantfor example not the sexual orientation of the director or the alleged drug habits of the production team lol patrick stettners direction was moody and dark and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those so sought after feelings of tension and release rather than the messy fast paced camera work and quick cuts were so often subjected to today some people can truly show you a story through their camera while others feel as if they have to make the story with the camera i really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized which is as an eyeball through which we all see 4 lighting cinematography and editing great all around ive already wrote so much and i could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs so ill just wrap it up in short go see this movie dont listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it especially if theyre so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 1 4 of the way through their post enjoy the show  ben', 'somewhat funny and well paced action thriller that has jamie foxx as a hapless fast

million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot dead bait marks the sophomore feature for antoine fuqua the replacement killers and he handles the task fairly well even though it doesnt top his first movie what the two films have in common is the action sequences which are flat out excellent foxx is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning but throughout the

burnt alive seven people in a mission in guatemala in the 70s also he declared that he had murdered another 16 people he used to kill pregnant women and then he set them on fire this movie is a documentary that portraits the personality of aro through several interviews with people that got to know him and through some scenes played by actors based on real facts aro tolbukhin is a serious work so analytical its not morbid at all such a horrifying testimony about how some childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster *my rate 7 10', 'after seeing several movies of villaronga i had a pretty clear opinion about him    he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters forgetting about a rhythm of the movie that is why though having good critics his movies never caught the broad audience attention in aro he follows the same line but really improved on the rhythm especially in the end of the movie frankly speaking i slept through the first part cause though the first part gives necessary information it is really slow nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by villaronga recommended', 'theres so many things to fall for in aro tolbukhin en la mente del asesino inside the killers mind that its very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning lets just say that this movie is like an exercise in cinema but really really great done it´s made with super 8 black and white shots 35 milimeters color interviews flashbacks aro tolbukhin it´s like a movie made a documental or viceversa which most peculiar aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering did he really ever existed the movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in guatemala worked in a religious mission and then killed some people an act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced the movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death nowadays some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character the one we are witness of  the movie for the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside aro´s mind mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done nevertheless the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions we clearly never justify them so the first half is based upon recollecting information later things turn into aros childhood giving the movie such an incredible new force even tough never got weak or boring i dont mean  and dont want  to spoil anything so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you believe me the trip to see it is more than worthy', 'this has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen the giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre this unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story the casts is outstanding including tom bosley who as far as i know never has been in a horror movie before ever the effects are impressive and the idea of a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one my one complaint i just wish we saw more of the giant mummy but other then that i think they did a great job the dialog the characters and the story was perfect the acting was wonderful this has got to be the best movie to come out of the sci fi channel you heard me the best movie to come out of the sci fi channel i give the fallen ones 9 out of 10', 'without kirsten miller this project neednt have been completed however with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is miss miller i would definitely recommend it it looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance wagners dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing but his few scenes didnt detract from being entertained mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster the charismatic miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable she plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be i wish i had seen this on the big screen but alas i was fortunate to rent it before it was lost', 'sure titanic was a good movie the first time you see it but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change the first time you see the movie you see the underlying love story and think ooh how romantic the second time and i am not the only one to think this it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking when is this d**n ship going to sink and even this is not as impressive when you see it several times the acting in this film is not bad but definetly not great either was i glad dicaprio did not win an oscar for that film i mean who does he think he is anthony hopkins or denzel washington he does 1 half good movie and wont do a film for less than $20 million and then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it but enough about in my eyes the worst character of the film kate winslets performance on the other hand was wonderful i also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together there is one lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many love stories as it is filmmakers shouldnt try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie out of a possible 100% i give this film a mere 71%', 'when i saw this movie i was stunned by what a great movie it was this is the only movie i think i would ever give a 10 star rating i am sure this movie will always be in my top 5 the acting is superb leonardo dicaprio and kate winslett are at their best i dont think anyone could have a better job than kate  if it is a rainy day and you cant decide what to rent well this is the one you will love all the acting special effects and much much more if you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now you wont regret it ', 'why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like the godfather titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st centurywith great actingdirectingeffectsmusic and generally everything this movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didnt like it any more so most of the world decided to agree there is nothing wrong with this movie all i can say is that this movie not only being the most heavily oscar awarded movie of all time the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies ive ever seen apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time the only movies that come close to being like all the star wars and the lord of the rings trilogy or anything by the masters hitchcock or spielberg or tim burton these are all good movies and directors but none match up to james camerons masterpiece titanic', 'just two commentsseven years apart hardly evidence of the films relentless pulling power as has been mentioned the low budget telemovie status of 13 gantry row is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal having said that however the thing is not without merit   either as entertainment or as a fright outing per se true the plot at its most basic is a re working of the amityville horror   only without much horror more a case of intrigue gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played halifax  investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the house as the main suspect the script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard it just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments having picked the dvd up for a mere $395 last week at my regular video store i cannot begrudge the expenditure $1095 would be an acceptable price for the film just dont expect fireworks', 'whats inexplicable firstly the hatred towards this movie it may not be the greatest movie of all time but gimme a break it got 11 oscars for a reason it made eighteen hundred million dollars for a reason its a damn good movie which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it i have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when i saw it in theaters ive rewatched it on tv and video and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen twice or maybe three times actually but that might be it the appeal of it its a movie yes capital m there its an epic its a spectacle in the order of gone with the wind or ben hur now ben hur and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama not that titanic has none of that well the acting was actually very good the melodrama was quite heavy handed at times but the reason titanic works is that its such an emotional ride i usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind or give me a visual thrill this movie isnt exactly dumb but its not cerebral at all the visual thrills are simply means to an end to fuel the emotions of the audience i didnt cry when bambis mom died i dont react to tearjerkers but this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million an emotional rollercoaster that if it were a regular one would make buzz aldrin scream like a little girl and im sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it and have a ready supply of cynicism then you can thoroughly dislike this movie but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt youll enjoy it completely and look at the top ten grossing films of all time is a single one of them bad is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10 no not even the phantom menace and this movie made 18 billion dollars worldwide it cant be bad not possible 10 10 ps how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman spiderman was a fun movie but it was a total 9 11 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did it simply wasnt anything all that special no one will remember it in 50 years but im pretty sure titanic will be remembered', 'previously i wrote that i loved titanic cried at its ending many times over and im a guy in his 60s i also wondered about why this great movie which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics was given only a 70 rating by imdbcom users well i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings while 290% of all votes gave it a 10 rating 107% gave it a 1 rating these 107% of these irrational imdb users in effect pulled the overall rating down to 70  in my previous comments i blamed this very unusual voting pattern a sudden surge in 1 ratings with a high 10 rating dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level on only one thing hatred for leonardo dicaprio believe me ive tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people young men mostly who defame him left and right they absolutely hate the man and they will have no part in giving him any credit in titanic to answer one other user i am not talking about someone who just really doesnt like the movie that much and gave it a 5 or a 6 etc everyone has and is entitled to his her own taste but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 70 overall for titanic pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of titanic to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical bombs there are many more but these 5 will prove my point heavens gate 1980 was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing and imdb voters ratings were 232% 10 ratings and 92% 1 ratings overall rating of 61 big top pee wee 1988 got 43% 10 ratings and 99% 1 ratings overall rating of 45 cat people 1982 got 61% 10 ratings and 26% 1 ratings overall rating of 58 blind date 1987 got 30% 10 ratings and 28% 1 ratings overall rating of 53 jumpin jack flash 1986 got 44% 10 ratings and 37% 1 ratings overall rating of 52 what do all of these films have in common with titanic all of the percentages of their 1 ratings are lower  than titanic and none of these stinkers ever was nominated for a single award again titanic got 107% 1 ratings compare that to the other 5 movies i just mentioned can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor ', 'i loved this movie since i was 7 and i saw it on the opening day it was so touching and beautiful i strongly recommend seeing for all its a movie to watch with your family by far my mpaa rating pg 13 for thematic elements prolonged scenes of disastor nudity sexuality and some language', 'the movie titanic makes it much more then just a night to remember it re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten why so criticised i have no idea could will they ever make a movie like titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece it will be almost impossible the director no doubt had the major impact on the film a simple disaster film boring to watch converted to an unbelievable romance yes im not the romance type either but that should not bother you because you will never see a romance like this guaranteed everything to the amazing effects to the music to the sublime acting  the movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling everything looks very real and live the legend herself titanic is shown brilliantly in all classes too looks too accommodation the acting was the real effect dicaprio and winslet are simply the best at playing there roles no one could have done better they are partly the reason why the film is so great  i guess its not too much to talk about the plot is simple the acting is brilliant based on a true story probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten well if you havent seen this film your missing out on something hesterical and a film to idolise for hollywood could it get better no not at all the most moving film of all time dont listen to people see for yourself then you will understand a landmark dont be surprised if you cry too', 'i had few problems with this film and i have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated true it is over three hours long but i was amazed that it goes by so quickly i dont think it is overrated at all i think the imdb rating is perfectly decent the film looks sumptuous with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects and the direction from james cameron rarely slips from focus leonardo dicaprio gives one of his best performances as jack and kate winslet is lovely as rose david warner a great actor steals every scene hes in the story is very rich in detail and is hot on character development obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow the last hour is extremely riveting and i will confess that i was on the edge of my seat when the titanic sank i will also say that the last five minutes were very moving the music score by james horner was lovely though i never was a huge fan of the song my heart will go on the 1996 miniseries was good but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies overall i give titanic an 85 10 bethany cox', 'i think james cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies anyway everyone remembers the rms titanic it was big fast and unsinkable until april 1912 it was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever well james cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship well onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film so our two main characters are jack leonardo dicaprio and rose kate winslet theyre not annoying too much but watch this and youll find out why they could become annoying  http  tinyurlcom ojhoyn  the main villain i guess is bad luck fate hand of god no blasphemy intended or just plain caledon hockley billy zane combine all of the above and what do you get oh yes we get a love story on a sinking boat the supporting characters are the following my personal favorite mr andrews victor garberidk he was so nice lovejoydavid warner murdochewan stewart lightoller jonathan phillips captain smithbernard hill molly brownkathy bates and many more we also got the present day treasure hunter brock lovett bill paxton they add something to the story something good the action in here is awesome especially in the second half the drama as also good in the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears the story is simple and it works a treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond she calls and tells her tale on the rms titanic two lovers separated by social class and ultimately the fate of the ship everything about the story works and there are very few flaws i give titanic an 86% awesome', 'titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill fated voyage on the unsinkable ship writer director james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april 15 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the north atlantic the two leads in the film are great in their roles including leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet they make for a good on screen couple dicpario and winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane kathy bates frances fisher jonathan hyde and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film the love story the action suspense and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for its few flaws titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the titanic sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg overall titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially dicaprio and winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch', 'the ship may have sunk but the movie didnt director james cameron from the terminator did it again with this amazing picture one of my favorite scenes is the dinner table scene in which roses family and friends meet jack after he saves her rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet the onei hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future husband jack and rose have a connection that is movie stuff but its good movie stuff we have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth rose almost commits suicide but the gilbert grape star rescues her i really liked the hanging over the boat scene it was a good risk the movie is long but its fantastic good story good flow good actors go see it twice if you want its worth it', 'titanic has to be one of my all time favorite movies it has its problems what movies dont but still its enjoyable when i stumble across someone who asks me why i like titanic i suppose my first reaction is wait a minute you dont i know so many people who dont like this movie and im not saying i dont see why the love story is too cheesy well yes but isnt it enjoyable and moving all right the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic everyone knows that love like this doesnt actually exist but this is a movie doesnt everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while the next complaint dicaprio and winslet are terrible actors well ok in this movie i agree that they do not perform to their full potentials however i think its unfair to say that they are terrible actors i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in but the roles they are given are simple and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected and finally if one is going to complain that they dont like this movie because they hate romance or because they hate history or tragic movies then im sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things its like people who complain the dark knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies simply for being a movie not because you dislike the genre this is a good movie well deserving of its oscars in particular best cinematography which i find to be the best ive ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogy i know some of the writing fails such as the constant screaming of each others names throughout the movie the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times but overall its an amazing achievement in making the titanic look so real and the sinking feel so epic i understand why a lot of people dislike this movie but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea such as it being a love story rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed i can tell you that i have read more than five books about the titanic including memoirs form the day it happened and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults the only main ones i can find is that the piping should be threaded copper not steel and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it i give this movie 10 10 not because i like romance movies but simply because its an outstanding cinematic achievement that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events', 'titanic is a classic i was really surprised that this movie didnt have a solid ten overall in the imdb user rankings maybe its just cool to not give titanic credit nowadays but when it was first made it was really something when the movie came out people flocked to the theaters when it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month it was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot like the frozen baby or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd many people died on that ship and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to and lets not forget the amazing romance between jack and rose whether or not their relationship was a figment of someones imagination it was lovely they barely knew each other but they would die for each other they trusted each other they sure as hell are giving romeo and juliet a run for their money ill never let go jack titanic is a great film down to its very core it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting excellent cinematography beautiful music and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers it really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie', 'another aussie masterpiece this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural and it does very well it doesnt resort to the big special effects overkill like american flicks it focuses more on emotional impact a relatively simple plot that rebecca gibney & co bring to life it follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago strange things begin to happen in the house and john adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared who was actually a mass murderer highly recommended 8 10', 'for me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time no exceptions james cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller through films such as aliens the abyss and both terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science fiction goes he sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film but titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance the film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful interesting and entertaining film about it the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio who plays jack and kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films i get annoyed when the supporting characters arent given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly rose gloria stuart tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is roses and jacks story alone no one else emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home the music has become iconic and legendary it is composer james horners finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience the song after so long has become annoying but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is only one problem the usual james cameron problem is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside james cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime my heart wont go on from this one', 'back in 1997 do i remember that year clinton bans cloning research the unfortunate death of princess diana the marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets this was also the big year in the release of titanic one of the biggest films of all time a tale about the ship of dreams about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster i dont think anybody could have expected titanic to be as huge as it was the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans 85% of them being teenage girls i was 12 years old at the time and of course saw the movie multiple times it was the film that made me believe that the love that jack and rose shared was so real and beautiful at the time i felt that titanic could do no wrong of course i grew up and didnt watch the film since i was 14 a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for 599 and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now was it worth the hype was it really the best movie of all time was that leonardos real nose ok i know thats silly to say but i did re watch the film being completely honest here titanic is a great movie best movie of all time no just depends on your idea of a good movie but titanic delivered in romance humor disaster emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage the film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms titanic searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean unsuccessful they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude wearing the heart of the ocean dated the day the titanic sank 101 year old rose dawson calvert learns of the drawing and contacts lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing she and her granddaughter elizabeth lizzy calvert visit lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship when asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the titanic revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater in 1912 the upper class 17 year old rose boards the ship with her fiancé cal hockley and her mother ruth dewitt bukater both of whom stress the importance of roses engagement to cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the dewitt bukater debts while they have the outward appearance of the upper class rose and her mother are financially broke distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern before she leaps a drifter and artist named jack dawson intervenes jack and rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first class formal dinner of the rapport building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of irish dance music and beer in third class but after cals servant informs him of roses whereabouts rose is forbidden from seeing jack again however after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven year old daughter to behave like a proper lady at tea rose defies him and her mother asking jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the heart of the ocean an engagement present from cal after a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time they go to the deck of the ship they then witness the ships fatal collision with an iceberg after overhearing the ships lookouts discussing how serious the collision is rose tells jack they should warn her mother and cal meanwhile cal discovers roses nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe so he frames jack for stealing the heart of the ocean by having lovejoy plant it in jacks pocket upon learning cal intends to leave jack to die below deck rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him jack and rose return to the top deck cal and jack though enemies both want rose safe so they persuade her to board a lifeboat but after realizing that she cannot leave jack rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with jack in the ships first class staircase jack and rose return to the top deck the lifeboats have gone and the ship finally goes down into the freezing atlantic taking jack and rose down so does titanic live up to its hype i still say that this is a great movie to watch i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie but it has great acting amazing effects a well written story and still looks flawless love it or hate it you have to admit this movie didnt get a lot of hype just because of leos baby face or kates amazing ability to cry on sight this film is something special it will always hold a special place in my heart it has too seeing that i saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released but all that aside i do recommend this movie its a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day 10 10', 'james camerons titanic is essentially a romantic adventure with visual grandeur and magnificence a timeless tragic love story set against the background of this major historical event its an astonishing movie that exemplifies hope love and humanity  leonardo dicaprio is terrific on screen with big charisma conveying passion trust insouciance and ingenuity hes a free spirited wanderer with artistic pretensions and a zest for life  kate winslet is absolutely lovely as the confused

the visual effects are amazing like no other films the decor is overwhelming james horners music intensifies the emotions the whole movie is hunting and involving filled with a wide range of deep feelings  its truly a moving tribute to those who lost their lives on that unfortunate ship', 'this movie re wrote film history in every way no one cares what anyone thinks about this movie because it transcends criticism every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it it is an extremely beautiful movie and i doubt many of us will see anything like it again ive seen it more times than i care to count and i still become transfixed every time with a feeling which is hard to describe one for the ages', 'titanic directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the titanic the plot is simple noncomplicated or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film but the love story is an interesting one however kate winslett is wonderful as rose an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal billy zane early on the voyage rose meets jack leonardo dicaprio a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game if he wants something he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyes the movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures that sunk with the titanic which has recently occurred one of the survivors of the titanic rose dewitt bukater who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic with this the scene shifts to southhampton ireland where the titanic set sail from on april 10 1912 as all the passengers are boarding after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger jack dawson captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty two years of experience to stretch the titanics legs out to full speed the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie on april 15 1912 at 1139 an iceberg was sighted they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 218 when the lights finally failed the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanics many pleas for help the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking also the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle overall the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanic many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship the core group of rose jack cal and roses mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer thomas andrew the white star line representative bruce ismay and all of the titanics officers were real the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smiths last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards he had been a part of the white star line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaires captain when the titanic sunk the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former canadian hometown as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower class passengers from non english speaking nations in addition officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss not wanting to leave her husbands side mrs strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic furthermore mr goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best the richest man on the ship john jacob astor who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat in addition molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water her ticket on the titanic had cost over four thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware the gymnasium which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re creation of the post victorian era of 1912 the rich at this time practically ruled everything as the womens suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do the rich did not take well to `new money such as molly brown as depicted everything of the time was very formal women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent cross referencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise the director james cameron shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in peoples lives everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night in addition this film is a reflection of the 1990s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed however the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter technically the film is very well done to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie in addition a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship furthermore throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art a true epic like most history novels we know the ending but it doesnt take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming sound cintematography and editing if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900s and how they face disaster then this movie definitely is for you ', 'i find it so amazing that even after all these years we are still talking about this movie obviously this movie wasnt that bad or else people wouldnt even bother to talk about it i personally enjoyed this film immensly and still do i guess this film isnt for everyone but it certainly did touch the hearts of many  as for those that think that this film is overrated or over hypedwell we only have the movie going public to thank for that lol* you see its not critics article writers that make a film huge or a hit with the general movie going public people make the film a huge success with titanic everyone was in awe lets face it a film like this had never been made before at least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking this film is so accurate that even james cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the real sinking that fateful day in april 1912 even the silverware for goodness sakes matched  give this movie a break you guys the critics thought this movie would sink big time when this movie actually came out and people started hearing by word of mouth which is the best form of advertisement mind you that this was a good decent movie worth seeing then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movienot once not twice but maybe 3 times and more so i really wouldnt say that this movie was overhypedat least not like the buildup for the matrix reloaded or the hulk is being overhyped ha critics didnt even think that titanic would make enough money to cover camerons gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film however the films money took care of that 200 million budget and much more  personally i love this film however this film might not be for everyone dont say that this film sucks just because of romance though that is the most sexist thing ive ever heard disliking a movie just because it has romance in it the story was sweet the dialogue could have been better but lets face itthe real star of the movie wasnt leo or kateit was that gigantic ship i think all of the actors including dicaprio and winslet did a fine job its not thier best work ive seen much better work from both of them but it wasnt the worst ive seen on screen before give them a break ', 'i avoided watching this film for the longest time long before it was even released i had dismissed it as an over hyped over blown overly romanticized piece of hollywood schmaltz and i wanted nothing to do with it i never watched it in the theatre i shook my head in disbelief at the 11 academy awards   even though i had never seen it then i was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest one of the girls spoke about this movie it was so great she said you really felt like you were on the ship nonsense i thought i shared my feelings with my fellow judges one looked at me and said you might be right but if she liked the movie that much maybe shell want to learn more about the real titanic the movie must have done something right to get her so interested well maybe thought i then it finally appeared on pay tv ok i thought ill give it a look see i didnt want to like it   and i didnt i loved it what a great movie where to start first   the directing my high school public speaking contestant was right james cameron does a superb job of creating an almost you are there type of atmosphere the gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world the nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads then the rising sense of panic you dont just watch it you really do feel it then   the performances the lead performances from kate winslet as rose and leonardo dicaprio as jack are excellent   winslets being the superior i thought but both were good they had their rich girl poor boy characters down to a perfect t i thought in my opinion though stealing the show was frances fisher as roses mother she was perfect as the snobby aristocrat and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at jack then   the details im no expert on the sinking of the titanic but i have a reasonable general knowledge and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance very impressive indeed then   the song who can watch this movie and not be taken with celine dions performance of my heart goes on problems well the romance was perhaps too contrived in the sense that i just dont accept that jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class i know he was invited the first time but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until hes been there for a while the realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed i thought when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats  a minor quibble though this is truly an excellent movie my only regret is not seeing it in the theatre where i think it would have been so much more impressive 9 10', 'to all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue the budget the this and the thatwho wants to hear it if you missed the point of this beyond beautiful movie thats your loss the rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think i am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life and this one stands in its own entity in my book it was not supposed to be a documentary or a completely factual account of what happened that night it is the most amazing love story ever attempted i know that it is the cynical 90s and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy but come on someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money how lame is that it made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet and is the top grossing film in the planet i will gladly side with the majority this time around okay cynics time to crawl back under your rock i am done', 'every once in a while the conversation will turn to favorite movies ill mention titanic and at least a couple people will snicker i pay them no mind because i know that five years ago these same people were moved to tears by that very movie and theyre too embarrassed now to admit it i just rewatched titanic for the first time in a long time expecting to simply enjoy the story again i was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years i cried again in all the same places it brought me back to 1997 when i can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time a movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie i can recall yes even more than star wars and today many people wont even admit they enjoyed it folks lets get something straight    you dont look cool when you badmouth this film you look like an out of touch cynic no movie is perfect and this one has a few faults some of the dialogue falls flat and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly however none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are wonderful leo is one of the fine actors of his generation wait til you see him in gangs of new york before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy kate winslet was so strong in this film the movie really was hers and she held it together beautifully james cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable titanic the sinking scenes were horrific just as they were that night how anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me i was utterly transfixed this film is one memorable scene after another titanic leaving port in southampton rose and jack at the bow flying iceberg right ahead the screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean the screams of the doomed after she went down and that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears the music which has also been a victim of the films success was a key ingredient james horners score was simply perfect and the love theme was beautiful and tragic too bad celine dions pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many i confess i am a titanic buff as such i relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it    in all its beauty perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because ive had such an interest in the ship all my life however i doubt many of those i saw crying were titanic buffs i applaud cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy the film was made with such humanity another reviewer said it better than i ever could open up your hearts to titanic and you will not be disappointed', 'i am not a parent neither am i a male but i was able to identify with every characters heartaches and pains this is a movie teenagers should watch maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again im sorry for those that dont understand the value of love family and friendship it was very interesting to watch patrick duffy in a different role than that of bobby ewing and it is great to see a 19 year old ben affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance he showed at an early age that he is capable of heartfelt drama he should be offered more serious roles note hollywoodland his first serious role in years and he went out and won best actor at the venice festival in 2006 this movie can be appreciated by people of all ages maybe shouldnt be watched by children under 10 because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families but i recommend it to the entire family i bought this movie on dvd and have watched it with friends many times because it portrays the values that are important in life', 'after a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted urban turn of the century australian street we meet julie rebecca gibney and peter john adam as they go out house hunting they manage to get a loan for a fixer upper on a posh sydney street but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home it just may be haunted 13 gantry row combines a memorable if somewhat clichéd story with good to average direction by catherine millar into a slightly above average shocker the biggest flaws seem partially due to budget but not wholly excusable to that hurdle a crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film the opening thriller scene features some wonky editing freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that theres not much action suspense should be created from staging not fancy fix it in the mix techniques there is great atmosphere in the scene from the location the lighting the fog and such but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street showing their increasing proximity the tracking and the cuts need to be slow the attack needed to be longer clearer and better blocked as it stands the scene has a strong made for television feel and a low budget one at that after this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves the story has a lot of similarities to the amityville horror 1979 though the budget forces a much subtler approach millar and scriptwriter tony morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios often dramatic in nature instead of special effects oriented such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall for some horror fans the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama at least the first half hour of the film is primarily about julie and peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in but morphett writes fine intelligent dialogue the material is done well enough that its often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later  especially if youve gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house once they get settled and things begin to get weirder even though the special effects often leave much to be desired the ideas are good the performances help create tension there isnt an abundance of death and destruction in the film  theres more of an abundance of home repair nightmares but neither menace is really the point the point is human relationships there are a number of character arcs that are very interesting the house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it that its in a posh neighborhood and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe such as money or health problems peters character evolves from a striving corporate employee with normal work based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful at the same time we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship although 13 gantry row never quite transcends its made for television clunkiness as a tv movie this is a pretty good one with admirable ambitions anyone fond of haunted house films psycho films or horror thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy it certainly isnt worth spending $30 for a dvd that was the price my local pbs station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it factoring in shipping and handling but its worth a rental and its definitely worth watching for free', 'daniell steels daddy what a refreshing story this movie glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children how rare is that in these times of heather has two mommies or what ever you fill in the blanks it is easy to see why this theme is not for everyone with the fathers roles being prominent i was hoping this would be another daniell steel saga how disappointing to have it end every character was important and did a fabulous job carrying their role i would have loved to see each character develop over the years i loved this movie it is one i will defiantly watch every time its on good story good acting and i hope this isnt a spoiler but no obtrusive sex or bad language yes it touched my heart warning get the kleenex ready what i find sad is that this side of family life is rarely depicted today in our

characters did outstanding performances yes i shed a tear along the way knowing i had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent this true to life is one which every young adult and parent would do well to see although some will not realize it until they too are parents a must see for those who care about their families', 'its heart warming to see a movie that doesnt bash males in this one the wife mother leaves her family to get in touch with herself   or pursue her libido the father stays with and nurtures the kids letting neither his work nor his love life interfere with his love of and responsibility to them', 'i must admit when i read the description of the genre on netflix as steamy romance i was a little bit skeptical steamy in a movie from 1968 i was prepared for disappointment and when i realized it was shot entirely in black & white i knew my erotic hopes were dashed boy was i wrong not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance    the discovery of first love fear of the secret being found out a sudden unexpected end    but at times this movie was downright erotic you will soon forget that it is shot in black & white the cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years and the performances from the two stars essy persson and anna gael are intense and memorable ok so theyre both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls its 1968 do you really expect teenagers from the 60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much i think this movie was way ahead of its time the level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown i have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here as for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action although it wont be all you expect i dont think youll be too too disappointed', 'this is a film not porn this is a wonderful film full of tender moments and memories a beautiful piece of work excellent for intelligent viewers only if you are a film lover a romantic a person who has loved deeply this is your film it has a beautiful surreal quality fine acting and directing watching this film made me remember my first love thi is a film for those who want to reflect on life love and the meaning of loss highly recommended for all film lovers', 'it was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two schoolgirls and did not try to exploit its fact\\x85 even by todays standards the film is interesting and provocative\\x85  therese and isabelle are both attending the same girls school\\x85 therese is energetic intelligent and becomes a mentor for the innocent naive sweet isabelle\\x85 she guides her through a number of exotic experiences including a trip through an exclusive brothel into her first lesbian liaison and indirectly into her first heterosexual experience\\x85  the film does not exploit any sex nor is there an abundance of nudity the imagery is effective but sometimes the camera lingers too long and the story goes slowly\\x85  the director radley metzger went on to make a number of explicit erotic films under the name of henry paris\\x85 he always has extremely detailed stories good acting and very high standards of cinematography artistically however this is perhaps his most complete\\x85 his later attempts supplied for entertainment whereas therese and isabelle was a study into the nature of youthful eroticism', 'we watched this in my womens health issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies and i absolutely loved this movie i plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch the story is very touching and i would recommend it to anyone i am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what i needed this is a movie for the whole family despite its rating this is a movie i will show to my children the professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women but this movie was more than that it is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite', 'i was going to bed with my gf last night and while she was brushing her teeth i flipped channels until i came across this chinese movie called the king of masks at first i thought it was going to be a kung fu movie so i started watching it and then it immediately captured me in and i had to finish it the little girl in the movie was absolutely adorble she was such a great actor for being so little maybe the fact it was in chinese so the english was dubbed made it harder for me to tellbut she really seemed to be in character perfectly i felt so bad for the girl as she kept trying to please her boss but everything just turned out rotten lol even when she brings him another grandson just so he can pass on his artit turns out that kid was kidnapped so he gets arrested and has 5 days to live lolwhatever she touches in an effort to be nice to her grandpa just backfires in the end he sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of maskswhich is just so heartwarming after all the mishaps in the movie definitely a gem and totally original scott', 'i admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of his her reluctant guardian ive seen enough of them \\x97 baby boom kolya about a boy mostly martha and to some extent whale rider \\x97 to expect to be bored by the formula what held my attention in the king of masks was the grimness of the setting small town china in the 1930s extreme poverty was the norm and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market when wang discovers his purchased grandson whom hes nicknamed doggie is a granddaughter he initially casts her out even though shes showed great promise as street performing heir even after he reluctantly takes her back hes not too upset when shes kidnapped the film is gritty then showing the lengths to which a young street smart girl had to go to survive in that society the two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context in a western society one would expect at least a hint of resentment from wang at not having achieved more material success wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status though that i did too while doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern suburban child its completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage and after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her her fierce attachment to wang makes perfect sense the peek at small town life in a foreign country the naturalness of the two lead actors the surprising plot twists and of course the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film', 'this movie is the best film ever i cant remember the last time a movie has drawn tears out of me with a tear in my eye i admire this movie it has all the elements that a good movie must have excellent dialogues music acting story plot a story of friendship courage kindliness and loyalty between a street performing who famous to the king of masks and a little girl that sold as a boy in serf bazaar little girl liked to be his granddaughter and king of masks liked a grandson they were not conventional in real every scene they were together was priceless the camera work is flawless and grips you the acting is inspired xu zhu was excellent as the king of masks renying zhou doggie looks pretty and played her character very well zhigang zhao as liang sao lang was great he played his helpful and kindhearted character extremely well if you havet this movie try it once do watch it', 'verhoevens movie was utter and complete garbage hes a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed by his own admission he read 2 chapters of the book got bored and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch heinlein would have never supported that trash if hed been alive to see it it basically steals the name mocks politics of the book which is a good portion of it and throws in some t&a so the average idiot american moviegoer doesnt get bored this anime isnt perfect but its at least mostly accurate as best i can tell', 'wang bianlian is an old street performer who is known as a king of masks for his mastery of sichuan change art liang is a famous opera performer of sichuan art and respects wang as an artist and as a person liang is worried that a precious art shouldnt die with wang and so he sows the seed of an heir in to wangs mind the film is about prejudices male domination state of art values and most importantly warmth i cant recommend this film enough the whole film is in loops everything has a significance its a long story which has been edited so well that the length of the film is just 91 minutes a total satisfaction for five minutes it is an artistic film next five minutes its a sad film next five minutes its a thriller it just keeps changing its mood like its protagonist changes his face last scene on the rope is phenomenal story and script is flawless actors are brilliant both the protagonists are artists you can tell the way they have performed very impressive it was not even nominated for oscars that year english patient got the best film oscar and in the foreign film category kolya won kolya was just ok and about english patient the lesser said the better watch it 9 10', 'one of the most heart warming foreign films ive ever seen the young girl is an amazing talent stellar performances by her doggie the old man the king of masks and liang the living boddhisatva spoiler the deplorable treatment of children especially females is disturbing loved the music the original chinese dialog heightens the emotional intensity of the performances and the story this is a must see    enjoyable family film although not for very young children would have rated the dvd release even higher if the soundtrack had been transferred better onto the dvd and the transfer had included the widescreen version', 'wow what a wonderful film the script is nearly perfect it appears this is the only film written by minglun weii hope he has more stories in him the acting is sublime renying zhou as doggie was amazing    very natural talent and xu zhu was a delight   very believable as the jaded old traditionalist  the soundtrack was very effective guiding without being overwhelming  if only more movies like this were made whether in hollywood or hong kong  a family friendly well acted well written well directed near perfect gem', 'the filming is pleasant and the environment is keenly realistic i liked that it boldly redresses conceptions of the many difficult moral and social morays of the 1930s chinese mainland countryside as well as more basic human questions   i felt i could get a real sense of the times recreated even in splendid shots of traditional chinese theatre and in purist depictions of street living it seemed worthwhile to experience the interwoven role which buddhism plays is probably the most true to form   both in its menial and in its philosophic aspect perhaps the most effective that ive seen in chinese film casting is great images are memorable acting is solid enough thematically puerile but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of its expression', 'the king of masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship set in 1930s china during a time of floods we meet wang an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the awe of all who witness him when a famous operatic performer sees and then befriends wang he invites wang to join their troupe however we learn that wangs family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son learning that wang is childless wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever taking the advice to heart wang purchases an 8 year old to fulfill his legacy he would teach his new son doggie the ancient art of silk masks soon wang discovers a fact about doggie that threatens the rare and dying art together wang and doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it the story is absorbing the setting is serene and the costuming simple summarily it is an international award winning art film which cant help but to move and inspire', 'this is a superb movie suitable for all but the very youngest though accessibility for younger people was marred at least in the print which i saw by the use of some unfortunate choice of english sub titling for much of the film it is almost impossible to guess in which time period it is set   there is no modern technology shown not even the ubiquitous chinese bicycle just a drab almost monochrome everyday life against which is contrasted the dazzling display of the sezuan opera and of celebratory fireworks even when a group of soldiers refer to their imminent departure for a theatre of war this could still be any time in the past 150 years but then we briefly see a motor car   late 30s early 40s style   and we realise that we are watching a china on the verge of huge upheavals and that much of the world we are seeing is about to be swept away in the cataclysm of world war 2 and the communist revolution which makes the central characters desire to adhere to old customs and traditions all the more poignant but the film also raises issues which are of vital importance even today both within china and in other parts of the world the inequality between boys and girls men and women the trade for various purposes in young children corruption in society injustice the importance of friendship maybe im reading too much into this film but i dont think so i also think that it is a scandal that films of this calibre are often not shown in the united kingdom whilst dross is passed off as quality material but dont get me started on that', 'king of masks bian lian in china is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film winner of 16 awards from around the world this film based on a true story centers on wang bianlian a street performer in 1930s china who is growing older but has no heir to pass on his art of face change opera he has a unique talent of quickly changing masks in performance and no one knows how he does it he has a longing desire to have a grandson as his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir we then go to the streets and see that people are selling their children because they cant afford to take care of them some are even begging to take their daughters for free because daughters are not worth much in this society wang bianlians story goes on from there the film was so astonishingly good the acting was amazing and the issues were so weighty and well addressed there is the gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this time and place no one wants a little girl also interesting to note is that the famed opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the living bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman and while he is famous and well respected he regards himself as something low a half woman as we go further into the film the face the issues of human slave trade and its demand and thus the lack of a possible solution for it the brutality and corruption of the military and police and the helplessness and lack of power any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions this is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life and xu zhu the actor who plays wang bianlian presents yet another beautiful performance', 'this is how movies are supposed to be made a fascinating setting characters about whom you come to care deeply writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense this is a wonderful film    deeply moving without being sentimental highly recommended', 'this movie was excellent a sad truth to how culture tends to clash with the sexes this is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie you have the master who is steeped in tradition and kind hearted in his own way doggie despite being a girl thing to win his affections and you top it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions this equals on big happy movie in the end this movie does a good job at showing how steeped in tradition one can be so steeped that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets you see sides to a culture never seen before which helps enhance the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture the cinema photography is excellent in particular the opening parade sequence with all the sparkers bound to be in oscar contention for best foreign film', 'this movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation women and performers both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in china this makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture the only problem i had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors performance a welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies', 'robert a heinleins classic novel starship troopers has been messed around with in recent years in everything to paul verhoevens 1997 film to a tv series to a number of games but none of these so to speak has really captured the spirit of his novel the games are usually unrelated the tv series was more of a spin off and the less said about verhoevens film the better little do most know however that in japan an animated adaptation had already been done released the year of heinleins death and believe it or not despite its differences this 6 part animated series is plot wise the most faithful adaptation of heinleins classic the most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons something we were deprived of in verhoevens film like the book the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel though we see a fair amount of each while events happen differently than in the book the feel of the books plot is present rico and carmen have a romantic entanglement but its only slightly more touched upon than in the book while some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book it gets a bit of the anime treatment but what did you expect but its far superior to the film heinleins political views are merely excised as opposed to the film where they are reversed the big payoff of the series however is the climatic battle on klendathu between the troopers and the bugs aliens which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version overall i enjoyed this series because i wanted to see a vision closer to that of heinlein and i think they did pretty well with this if you can find this series give it a look', 'as i was watching this film on video last night i kept getting these tingles that told me this one will endure ive a feeling ill be watching this again and again for years to come its got all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a story film and even though some cultural references are obscure for me a western viewer at the core this is a universal tale', 'when tradition dictates that an artist must pass his great skills and magic on to an heir the aging and very proud street performer known to all as the king of masks becomes desperate for a young man apprentice to adopt and cultivate his warmth and humanity tho find him paying a few dollars for a little person displaced by chinas devastating natural disasters in this case massive flooding in the 1930s he takes his new 7 year old companion onto his straw houseboat to live with his prized and beautiful monkey general only to discover that the he child is a she child his life is instantly transformed as the love he feels for this little slave girl becomes entwined in the stupifying tradition that requires him to pass his art on only to a young man there are many stories inside this onemany people are touched and the culture of china opens itself for our western eye to observe thousands of years of heritage boil down into a teacup of drama and few will leave this dvd behind with a dry eye the technical transfer itself is not that great as i found the sound levels all over the meter and could actually see the video transfer lines in several parts of the movie highly recommended   9 10 stars', 'an unexpected pleasure as i had heard nothing about this film shameful since it warrants having a wider audience a wonderfully humane story with a social message gently told although admittedly predictable in its resolution solidly acted by the principals beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against grey that captures the nostalgic tone of the film my recent foray into chinese film shower the road home not one less has been an exciting one that i hope to continue exploring china and its people is an amazing canvas for film makers the king of masks can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in recent chinese film ', 'one of the great things about many of the superb chinese movies you can find if you are lucky in the video stores is they are very accurate retellings of actual true stories farewell my concubine the emperor and the assassin and this movie are perfect examples the film makers take a true story and work hard to accurately create a movie without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience    the hallmark of much hollywood and especially disney films in this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the king of masks for his mastery of sichuan change art along an having lost his only son many years earlier he searches to find a male heir to carry on his rare and dying art in a society that forbids females to have such work master wang is sold a son by a slave trader all is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art but the son eventually is found out to be a girl from there the story get very interesting with a good performance by master liang of the sichuan opera    a regional operatic style related to peking opera fans of farewell my concubine should look carefully at master liangs portrayal of a male playing the female role in chinese opera it may help them come to understand that the players of these female roles were probably not homosexuals or castrati but people who have be so psychologically conditioned as to be totally unaware of their own sexuality', 'quote by nicolas martin nicmart from houston tx fine film but dvd reformatted for tv 8 april 2002   this is a charming and emotive film on the other hand the dvd i purchased has been reformatted to fit your tv by the clods at columbia tristar there is no excuse for not providing the film in widescreen format except that hollywood treats all films like the moronic disposable trash that it is so used to producing what a shame what a criminal shame indeed however there is another version out though see here for details http  wwwdvdbeavercom film dvdcompare2 kingofmaskshtm wonderful performances by the two main actors the king and doggie btw', 'masks is a moving film that works on many levels at its simplest it is the haunting story of a street performer who bonds with a young child while trying to pass along his creative art masks to the next generation although at times the story makes the old man into a job it is so well crafted written acted directed wonderful production values it is easy to move beyond his plight and if you hang with it the film is ultimately very sweet and uplifting kudos all around this is a wonderful film for children as well as adults the trick is how to get americans who may not like foreign language films to see it', 'beautiful and touching movie rich colors great settings good acting and one of the most charming movies i have seen in a while i never saw such an interesting setting when i was in china my wife liked it so much she asked me to log on and rate it so other would enjoy too', 'this is probably my favorite movie of all time it is perfection in its storytelling it will break your heart not because its over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters go through you feel for doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in china at that time', 'its a tale that could have taken place anywhere really given the right circumstances street entertainer catching the attention of famous opera star and friendship ensuing the aging entertainer finds buys a male child to pass his art to from there we follow them through the rigors of their challenging but free life along the river traveling town to town he performs and has some degree of notoriety despite the times and the influences the man is kind and good overall the performances are first rate especially xu zhu who portrays the street performer the child renying zhou is beautiful and downright strong and withstands the overt prejudices well the two protagonists along with supporting help from the kind opera singer master liang an interestingly androgynous zhao zhigang paint a very interesting tale of forgiveness sadness and love some have mentioned this films remote similarities to ba wang bie ji farewell my concubine yet this film cant stand easily on its own any resemblance is remote at best my only qualm with the king of masks is the ending it was weak cliche and about as subtle as a sledgehammer the audience was already wrapped up in the story what was the needless manipulation for what a shame to bring a fine motion picture that far only to surrender to emotional and corny pathos like that it frankly made this film good instead of the classic it shouldve been that aside the king of masks is still very well worth your time i was happy to see the shaw brothers are still producing good films highly recommended', 'i enjoyed the cinematographic recreation of china in the 1930s in this beautiful film the story is simple an older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man although he has no living children the faces of the actors are marvelous to see the story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well the operas in the film remind me of farewell my concubine which was more sophisticated and intricate the story here reminds me of a dickens tale of days when children were almost chattel the plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the heroism humanity and history portrayed', 'ok lets get this clear im really not into sci fi but for some reason i love stargate sg 1  jack oneil takes his team sg 1 through a stargate a round device that creates a wormhole it gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds it might sound like your usual sci fi series but its not the plot is set today not in some distant millennium like many other sci fi series i find that great it gives you things happenings and such you can relate to and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets they have some of course but thanks to oneil who likes to keep a simple terminology theres not many  the series has a nice blending of action humor and drama if you enjoy loads of special effects youre not going to find it here they dont use many bad ones but a limited amount of well made special effects', 'in the rapid economic development of 1990s in china there is a resurgence of traditional chinese culture partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth and more importantly due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post cultural revolutionary era however the resurgence of chinese traditional culture namely the confucianism was not without disasters because chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example moreover not only the part that should be discarded were inherited the good part that was supposed to be inherited such as the traditional opera and its technique such as changing face was ignored in the resurgence and facing extinction the director used this film to criticize the problem of re embracing tradition by contemporary china and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie', 'this is a beautiful rich and very well executed film with a rich and meaningful story basically it tells how an old master story teller needs to find a male heir to carry on his craft but ends up not getting what he expected in his very male dominated world the characters must then deal with their situation and the old master must grapple with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and his and societys traditional notions the story is fun emotional and complex the exploration of the characters their lives and emotions is rich and compelling the character development is strong while the characters are complex and not one dimensional at all the film expertly conveys the old mans emotions and his desire to find an heir and compellingly shows how he and the kid handle the situation there is also humour sometimes quite subtle at appropriate points the film also examines the good and bad of traditional chinese culture creating further interest and depth to the film the directing acting and scenery are all outstanding added to the other strengths this creates rich and convincing visual images and compelling real characters as a result the film evokes strong empathy for and feelings about the characters some have claimed that the ending weakens the film but i do not necessarily agree perhaps it could have been stronger with a different ending but any improvement in the overall film would have been rather small', 'the movie is truly poignant unique and uplifting the story is universal in that its a battle between good evil and the world between the most important thing is that its rating is wrong misleading and a travesty blockbuster has it rated as though it were an x rated movie the truth is is that it is closer to g than pg and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple sub titles', 'the fact that this film was put out on dvd still formatted to tv and with a fuzzy picture really annoyed a lot of film puristsand rightly so this deserves a lot better treatment the story is about a street performer who needs a son to pass on his craft the rules of the day and winds up with a little girl instead not the conventional way and the problems that ensue afterward the old man had bought the kid at a slave auction and soon discovers the kid is not a boy which he obviously thought was the case the old man bianlian wang xu zhuis kind of funny looking with a missing front tooth and an infectious grin the little girl doggie zhou renying is a cutie the rest of the story is how the two manage after that i usually like a nice sentimental ending but this gets a bit carried away in the final 15 minutes overall its involving story complete with drama suspense humor and sadness just dont expect a good quality picture for the money you are spending on the dvd until it comes out on widescreen rent it', 'this spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen it shows a china i had never seen or imagined and i believe it shows 1930s china in the most real light ever seen in a movie it is absolutely heart breaking in so many situations seeing how hard life was for the characters and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful you truly see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film the actors are all perfect such that you feel like you have really entered a different world  i simply can not recommend this movie highly enough it may just change you forever once you have seen it', 'i just saw this movie today with my children son 10 and daughter 45 at the 3rd annual roger ebert overlooked film festival after the film the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director tian ming wu he through a translator told several stories about his life and the making of the film all tangents aside both of my children really enjoyed this movie of course i had to paraphrase many of the subtitles for my daughter but much of the film is visually self explanatory i wont give anything away but the bottom line is that this film is so much better than 95% of the hollywood crap especially childrens films out there cheers ps there is a real original king of masks who can could do 12 masks at once the actor in the movie trained and learned to do up to 4 masks at a time then they would cut and change to 4 new masks', 'this is a lot of silliness about a woman from london who marries a tea planter from ceylon whom she barely knows its full of cliches and the liz taylor character is not believable it has a marvelous set some exotic location footage it shows taylor at the height of her beauty she looks stunning', 'fabulous costumes by edith head who painted them on liz taylor at her finest the sfx are very good for a movie of its age and the stunt doubles actually looked like the actors even down to body type a rarity in movies of this vintage a cozy movie with splendid panoramas    even when chopped down to pan and scan', 'elephant walk 1954 starring an early peter finch as lord of the manor in some god forsaken plantation where there is always the danger of elephants or mad englishmen staying out in the midday sun and going berserk well eventually they do after the typhoid or cholera outbreak of course and much mayhem ensues taylor replaced an ailing vivien leigh in this pot boiler adventure flick when the elephants storm the house and trap liz on the grand staircase i still get goose bumps thank goodness dana andrews is around to save the day one of my favorite guilty pleasures in color too', '   or type on a computer keyboard theyd probably give this eponymous film a rating of 10 after all no elephants are shown being killed during the movie it is not even implied that any are hurt to the contrary the master of elephant walk john wiley peter finch complains that he cannot shoot any of the pachyderms  no matter how menacing  without a permit from the government and his tone suggests such permits are not within the realm of probability furthermore the elements conspire  in the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemic  to leave the wiley plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by the elephant people as the natives dub them to close the story if you happen to see the current release earth youll detect the elephant people are faring less well today', 'i got in to this excellent program in about season 4 and since then i have seen all the episodes got all the episodes on dvd and keeps getting better and better with the seasons of 9 and 10 it now may not have richard dean anderson now but the addition of ben browder and claudie black it has still given the show more strength and original still even after 10 seasons sadly now the sci fi channel got rid of this amazing show with no hope relay for a 11 season there are making two direct to dvd movie and hopefully more atlantis is still going strong on its 4th seasons and there is a third spin off in the works the stargate franchise is nowhere near dead this tv show is a must see for all sci fi fans and people of genres because this has such a wide range of things to appeal to all ages and all types of people watch it  10 10']\n"
